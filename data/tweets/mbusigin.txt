(Thu Apr 23 18:45:40 +0000 2015) @traderscrucible The natural real rate is a counterfactual study. We generally can observe whether it's too high or too low.
(Thu Apr 23 18:07:44 +0000 2015) @traderscrucible 3) This doesn't invalidate the NRR as a useful concept. We can tautologically define it, and estimate it.
(Thu Apr 23 18:05:36 +0000 2015) @traderscrucible , it's impossible to observe the NRR in real-time, and only axiomatically identifiable if it was too high or low ex-post.
(Thu Apr 23 18:05:00 +0000 2015) @traderscrucible 2) Because it's impossible to run an experiment to see what the economic effect of different rates would be ceteris paribus
(Thu Apr 23 18:04:15 +0000 2015) @traderscrucible 1) An even baser problem is defining NRR. To some, it's 0% CPI. To others, it's GDP neither higher or lower than potential.
(Thu Apr 23 17:51:58 +0000 2015) @naufalsanaullah @conorsen Me too, and I'm even more surprised he came to the same conclusion.
(Thu Apr 23 17:51:29 +0000 2015) @conorsen @naufalsanaullah I view the natural real rate as endogenous to monetary policy, for instance.

(Tue Apr 14 15:43:14 +0000 2015) TL;DR: management teams take signal from prices, not letters to the editor.
(Tue Apr 14 15:41:48 +0000 2015) Otherwise, they're just doing what their investors are signalling them to do.
(Tue Apr 14 15:41:45 +0000 2015) So, if investors like Fink really want to send management teams a signal to retain capital to invest, sell their bonds and buy their equity.
(Tue Apr 14 15:39:51 +0000 2015) ...I am more interested in today's cashflows than tomorrow's. Manage capital allocation accordingly.
(Tue Apr 14 15:39:26 +0000 2015) In this case, high multiples really just because we have low risk-free rates. LERP is still highly elevated, so signal *from* investors is..
(Tue Apr 14 15:38:27 +0000 2015) But we see a second measurement of this investor signal in LERP -- the difference between EY and corporate bond yield.
(Tue Apr 14 15:37:46 +0000 2015) b) The signal investors give to management teams re capital allocation in the multiple, and in LERP. Higher multiple means longer timeframe.
(Tue Apr 14 15:36:19 +0000 2015) a) Much like an increase in labour action, stuff like this is only said and done when it's all but inevitable already

(Sat Mar 28 17:59:10 +0000 2015) @graemehein @The_Analyst The more incompatible housing that was built, the more understated the cumulative housing deficit via this model is
(Sat Mar 28 17:58:38 +0000 2015) @graemehein @The_Analyst That really brings up final point: the majority of the recent (last 5y) building is incongruent with future demand.
(Sat Mar 28 17:57:11 +0000 2015) But that eases pricing pressures on those who remain in megopolis areas.
(Sat Mar 28 17:57:05 +0000 2015) As always, the action is on the margins. The people who move for a little less money to a more affordable city.
(Sat Mar 28 17:46:29 +0000 2015) The only thing that matters now is the pace that the Millennials realize they need to relocate to areas with better lifestyle opportunities.
(Sat Mar 28 17:43:48 +0000 2015) Not too many people are actually actively betting against it, of course. But many, many are betting against it passively.

(Sat Mar 28 17:38:24 +0000 2015) The deep cyclical wounds are fading, and the seeds of this starts rise are already in place. Cost to rent vs buy had trended absurdly low.

(Sat Mar 28 17:31:15 +0000 2015) We should be building about 50% more houses than we are, given the wage-growth, peak-aged population growth, job-growth and population.
(Sat Mar 28 17:30:18 +0000 2015) That over-building has reversed to the same magnitude and cumulative sum of under-building.
(Sat Mar 28 17:29:51 +0000 2015) Unsurprisingly, and to the credit of the model, we built far more houses from '01-06 than we needed, or could support with income.
(Sat Mar 28 17:28:57 +0000 2015) Additionally, we can observe when more houses were built than the fundamentals supported, as well as when less houses are built than needed.
(Sat Mar 28 17:28:14 +0000 2015) the income necessary to support the homebuilding. It turns out all of this has a decent statistical root: http://t.co/PA9ypFV3Ku
(Sat Mar 28 17:27:33 +0000 2015) Peak-aged population growth provides the fraction of starts to population necessary to support houshold formation, and payroll+income growth
(Sat Mar 28 17:25:12 +0000 2015) One could theorize that home building should be relative to wage growth, payroll growth, peak-aged population growth, and population size.

(Tue Mar 17 16:11:28 +0000 2015) @Mr_Minderbinder It's actually really simple, accurate because it's identities, and allows us to interpret market expectations which form EY
(Tue Mar 17 16:10:29 +0000 2015) @Mr_Minderbinder I develop the system of equations (Baa spread = Baa - 10s, etc), and then solve for the components.
(Tue Mar 17 16:09:27 +0000 2015) @Mr_Minderbinder That is, EY = LERP + (Baa spread) + (10y breakevens) + (10y real rate).

(Sun Mar 08 21:13:40 +0000 2015) You may assume 2.4% `A' growth too high. That view is consistent with a post-recovery, mid/end cycle environment constrained on labour.
(Sun Mar 08 21:12:15 +0000 2015) Naively assuming the average, A=2.4% + L=0.4% + K=1.2% = 4% is roughly around where growth ought to be.
(Sun Mar 08 21:08:41 +0000 2015) ...and then does well during recoveries, as the corporate sector leverages the over-built capital from the last cycle.
(Sun Mar 08 21:07:50 +0000 2015) `A' averages 2.4% outside of recession. `A' typically gets destroyed early recession (economy is overemployed, corp sector feels pain first)

(Fri Feb 27 12:57:08 +0000 2015) After decades of beatdowns, the low end of households probably had their best month - combining energy price declines &amp; wage increases.

(Wed Feb 25 03:40:56 +0000 2015) over the long term is dramatically underestimated.
(Wed Feb 25 03:40:42 +0000 2015) I see likely outcomes as an increase of short-term expectations first w/ well anchored long-term, and then mkt realising natural real rate
(Wed Feb 25 03:39:42 +0000 2015) expectations on the long end rising.
(Wed Feb 25 03:39:35 +0000 2015) The absurdist worst case would be inflation expectations continuing to decline in the &lt;=10y horizon, and either inflation or real rate
(Wed Feb 25 03:37:49 +0000 2015) Another expression of this tension. The aburdist best case scenario for equities is rates left at 0% perpetually while inflation rages.
(Wed Feb 25 03:36:27 +0000 2015) At the same token, 2s10s widening to 2% also likely infers 5-10y inflation expectations widening 20-40bps as well. Which compresses ERP.
(Wed Feb 25 03:34:54 +0000 2015) Risk to the discount on equities being too low is also expressed through curve being too flat. I estimate 2s10s widening to 2% = +67bps ERP.
(Wed Feb 25 03:28:34 +0000 2015) Once 1-10y inflation expectations normalize, be less room to run because they will bleed into 10-30y inflation - hence rates - expectations.
(Wed Feb 25 03:23:20 +0000 2015) w/o term premium causing equities' discount rate to rise.
(Wed Feb 25 03:23:17 +0000 2015) 30y inflation expectations *are* low, but they have stablised above 2%. 10y have fallen rapidly, so there is room for equities to appreciate
(Wed Feb 25 03:19:37 +0000 2015) If inflation expectations rise, in the medium-term (~10y), that'd be good for equities; but not if it pushes term premium up out farther.
(Wed Feb 25 03:18:48 +0000 2015) Equity valuation today is tension btwn low medium-term inflation expectations &amp; Fed Funds expectation for incredibly slow hiking schedule.

(Wed Feb 04 05:22:07 +0000 2015) Let me restate my thesis: high profit share is indicative that capitalists are bitches, and are too scared to invest. This is impermanent.
(Wed Feb 04 05:16:49 +0000 2015) @AppFlyer Nope. Firms are unwilling to do business with less profit. Margins will decline because they think they can make it up in revenue.
(Wed Feb 04 05:11:29 +0000 2015) I'm going to make the call right now, though - profit share peak. That is: firms will be increasingly willing to do biz at lower margins.
(Wed Feb 04 05:10:21 +0000 2015) There have been a lot of calls over the past 3-4 years for the top in profit margins. They had the story wrong - it's about risk premiums.

(Mon Feb 02 16:57:09 +0000 2015) @Prezntval @naufalsanaullah @groditi I still strongly disagree that 'ZIRP helps consumers less' means 'ZIRP can't help consumers'.
(Mon Feb 02 16:06:22 +0000 2015) @naufalsanaullah @groditi expectations plus minimum nominal return for risk. Kinda torn. Numerically very similar. Which way you guys go?
(Mon Feb 02 16:05:50 +0000 2015) @naufalsanaullah @groditi I think the exponent form infers that the relationship is highly convexed, while intercept-slope infers inflation
(Mon Feb 02 16:05:10 +0000 2015) @naufalsanaullah @groditi Q specifically for you: this intercept-slope model works very well, but so too does a single coefficient exponent.
(Mon Feb 02 13:10:29 +0000 2015) @naufalsanaullah @groditi Yeah. Of course, for all I know, it's (DGS30 + 4.3876)/361.3510 ;-)
(Mon Feb 02 11:59:54 +0000 2015) @naufalsanaullah @groditi 30y inflation expectations. It's a better series than BEs. And yes. R^2=0.9787, RMSE=0.3669.
(Mon Feb 02 11:44:01 +0000 2015) @naufalsanaullah @groditi 40bps negative term premium from my rough estimation; high but not insane http://t.co/Vjl6ahhxJA
(Mon Feb 02 11:22:32 +0000 2015) @groditi As I regressed earlier, 30y = -4.46 + ei30(3.364). But consumers don't just borrow at such long tenors.
(Mon Feb 02 11:21:31 +0000 2015) @groditi I'm not even convinced 30s are moved terribly much by ZIRP, anyway, because the Fed has credibility over that term.
(Mon Feb 02 02:38:15 +0000 2015) @groditi The *lowest* rates don't, sure.
(Mon Feb 02 02:02:55 +0000 2015) @groditi @Prezntval @BathosMan Surely not arguing that because there is a fluctuating spread, lower rates haven't led to lower mtg rates.
(Sun Feb 01 23:05:55 +0000 2015) @Prezntval @groditi @BathosMan is becoming less true every G.20 and Z.1.
(Sun Feb 01 23:05:14 +0000 2015) @Prezntval @groditi @BathosMan Nothing creative except we're all pretending that elasticity will remain zero to rates, when that
(Sun Feb 01 22:26:06 +0000 2015) @stwill1 Think about it another way - when comparing yields, EY is already real, while 10s are not. This balances that out.
(Sun Feb 01 20:03:54 +0000 2015) @BathosMan @groditi @Prezntval B/S recession different beast. But switching to normal biz cycle not discrete event - it's a process
(Sun Feb 01 19:55:35 +0000 2015) @groditi @BathosMan @Prezntval Except money. Money can be created at any cost desired.
(Sun Feb 01 19:54:39 +0000 2015) @groditi @BathosMan @Prezntval (numbers spitballed)
(Sun Feb 01 19:54:34 +0000 2015) @groditi @BathosMan @Prezntval It's incremental. As economy bottoms, maybe top 20% can; as it recovers, top 30%; as it grows, top 40%.
(Sun Feb 01 19:51:23 +0000 2015) @groditi @BathosMan @Prezntval That's akin to saying, "if poor class could [fully] take advantage of xfr payments, ..". Non-sequitur.
(Sun Feb 01 19:12:46 +0000 2015) @Prezntval Eh - the only people who disagreed didn't understand enough of the system to argue with.
(Sun Feb 01 18:51:09 +0000 2015) @Prezntval I'm a bad liberal, but I don't really care about income inequality that much apart from its implications on MPC/MPS/MPI.
(Sun Feb 01 17:36:04 +0000 2015) @stwill1 So to compare ERP with profit share, have to back out the inflation expectations component so it's a more direct comparison.
(Sun Feb 01 17:35:16 +0000 2015) @stwill1 Separating the inflation expectations from 10s is exactly why I did that. ERP declines as inflation expectations increase.
(Sun Feb 01 15:32:45 +0000 2015) @Prezntval by virtually every estimate: Taylor, Mankiw, mine
(Sun Feb 01 15:32:18 +0000 2015) @Prezntval It's not so much that there's a great need to raise rates now - there isn't - but the fact that higher rates already defensible
(Sun Feb 01 15:24:16 +0000 2015) @Prezntval I'm writing a piece on it. http://t.co/ZF6XQzzdg7 Using others + my own FF rules, easy to justify much higher rates very soon
(Sun Feb 01 04:23:47 +0000 2015) I've spent a lot of time recently working on modeling Fed Funds. This ZIRP-4eva thing rates complex priced in now is going to be unhappy.
(Sat Jan 31 22:29:43 +0000 2015) @Prezntval (which I think is likely)
(Sat Jan 31 22:27:20 +0000 2015) @Prezntval expectations reverse at the same time.
(Sat Jan 31 22:27:11 +0000 2015) @Prezntval Rates are too low, the curve is too flat. Both reversing will lower some asset prices. Equities will be spared if inflation
(Sat Jan 31 22:08:52 +0000 2015) @Prezntval He's long lost any credibility on both topics.
(Sat Jan 31 22:07:41 +0000 2015) @Prezntval Mish has been calling Canadian recession longer than I have. Problem is: he's also been calling US recession for just as long.
(Sat Jan 31 16:37:51 +0000 2015) @Prezntval That'll happen one day, but no day soon.
(Sat Jan 31 16:37:28 +0000 2015) @Prezntval Hiking into an inverted curve usually leads to a recession.
(Sat Jan 31 16:24:40 +0000 2015) You can see this cycle play out in EVERY recession and recovery.
(Sat Jan 31 16:23:13 +0000 2015) To wit: We'll see more capital deployed at lower expected ROIC. Makes sense:. If macro gives you 50% chance of success, u need 2x the return
(Sat Jan 31 16:20:30 +0000 2015) This is still a scenario where profits rise nominally - but potentially not in real terms, and most probably not as a % of GDP.
(Sat Jan 31 16:19:59 +0000 2015) As the risk premium compresses, returns on capital will go down (it will feel safer to make capital allocation bets), so too will profit/GDP
(Sat Jan 31 16:18:56 +0000 2015) Profits as % of GDP is really just the equity risk premium http://t.co/N5RaW0hyud
