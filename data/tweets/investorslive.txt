(Sun Apr 26 23:17:16 +0000 2015) RT @nik_costello: Re-watching @TandemTrader and finally starting to get it, calling plays before they happen @InvestorsLive, Thanks for ama…
(Sun Apr 26 23:17:05 +0000 2015) @MBKVNG what did you do?
(Sun Apr 26 23:16:36 +0000 2015) @swedepilot looks like whomever was on wood patrol was slacking
(Sun Apr 26 22:08:07 +0000 2015) Nice litttle Sunday fire .. I taught @swedepilot all he knows about starting a fire despite what… https://t.co/C2quhwyPxV
(Sun Apr 26 21:33:38 +0000 2015) @knighttrader85 bid/ask locked if you look they're the same price thus locked
(Sun Apr 26 20:00:09 +0000 2015) @holyhotmonkey those are just add ons - price is based of the momentum room alone rest are just extra benefits
(Sun Apr 26 19:50:48 +0000 2015) @splendores @Nikkorico_ just noticed $IMRS finally faded lol
(Sun Apr 26 19:34:33 +0000 2015) You know the market is nuts when $MSFT moves enough to likely be on scan for tomorrow
(Sun Apr 26 19:22:03 +0000 2015) Spring Time Cuts Prices in Half http://t.co/atJmgzDaKx
(Sun Apr 26 18:34:50 +0000 2015) @swedepilot @kristinalove209 you'd think by saving $200 a month you could afford some clothes to cover up -- blocked for dumb comment
(Sun Apr 26 18:31:25 +0000 2015) @kristinalove209 @swedepilot goal may to be to do it youself but still no better real time scanner on the Web than chat ;)
(Sun Apr 26 13:09:09 +0000 2015) We have a spring sale going on right now -- check out the specials: http://t.co/Zu2GBl1HlF $FB $VLTC $VGGL #stocks #daytrading

(Sat Apr 25 11:25:34 +0000 2015) @swedepilot @modern_rock happy real bday bro !!
(Fri Apr 24 22:11:19 +0000 2015) If you haven't watched this video with @lx21 yet put it on your to do list this weekend - so MANY great thoughts: https://t.co/G7JiCmkPTL
(Fri Apr 24 22:06:49 +0000 2015) Between $CLF $PBR &amp; a few other long trades we had I think I officially made more on the long side vs. short this week (that's a first lol)
(Fri Apr 24 20:04:10 +0000 2015) RT @offshorehunters: $AFMD chart update, killer way to start the weekend http://t.co/Onpys0pyXy

(Fri Apr 24 19:44:53 +0000 2015) $MSFT wow, what a MASSIVE move today for that stock
(Fri Apr 24 19:37:07 +0000 2015) $CLF yesterday .... $CLNE today :) huge
(Fri Apr 24 19:06:59 +0000 2015) $ENZN nice follow thru today!

(Fri Apr 24 17:51:56 +0000 2015) Darn $AMCN nice fader
(Fri Apr 24 17:33:39 +0000 2015) Locked in some gains on $LOOK along the way tho -- real nice off the curl
(Fri Apr 24 17:33:19 +0000 2015) Fundamental shorts are now being taken out back for a beating on $LOOK while technical traders are enjoying the breakout on momentum
(Fri Apr 24 17:32:11 +0000 2015) $LOOK sweet breakout
(Fri Apr 24 17:29:29 +0000 2015) $CALI hopefully LOD short chasers give us some good opportunity to re short higher from $2.10 covers (of partial)

(Fri Apr 24 17:26:48 +0000 2015) @patrick00000001 no that's 450k
(Fri Apr 24 17:16:20 +0000 2015) $LOOK she's back trying again after locking in all the "this is worth .75 cent shorts" piled in
(Fri Apr 24 17:03:15 +0000 2015) $CALI fresh lows
(Fri Apr 24 16:39:45 +0000 2015) I guess the reason I say that is b/c although I think $CALI slides off like $VGGL it's the chaser shorts that keep it up cuz they're silly
(Fri Apr 24 16:39:08 +0000 2015) $CALI by no means would I be shorting here we are short $2.50-2.60 range with some adds -- let the chasers short and cover on pops
(Fri Apr 24 16:31:50 +0000 2015) $CALI is today's $VGGL imo (just like yesterday)
(Fri Apr 24 16:30:30 +0000 2015) EDGX I see you $LEU haha now do you really want 450k or just having fun? http://t.co/fo6RmF9x63

(Fri Apr 24 15:39:10 +0000 2015) $TRIL about $5.50 bounce off the weak open red/green long idea yesterday -- sick move !!
(Fri Apr 24 15:22:53 +0000 2015) $MCP near $1
(Fri Apr 24 15:17:33 +0000 2015) $CALI fresh lows since short

(Fri Apr 24 14:38:12 +0000 2015) Thanks here's few other Uranium's again only if good vol comes in do I get really interested but always good to know https://t.co/PWNi66kxT3
(Fri Apr 24 14:32:50 +0000 2015) Nice calls $AGEN $NYMX @shaneblackmon nice work buddy past few days
(Fri Apr 24 14:32:18 +0000 2015) $LEU used to be $USU -- if you remember that run ... $URRE $UEC what other uranium stocks were hot? going to make a list
(Fri Apr 24 14:28:15 +0000 2015) $CALI lost its luster
(Fri Apr 24 14:27:24 +0000 2015) Watching $LEU $URRE alongside this $UEC breakout -- last time they all started going was insane so radaring
(Fri Apr 24 14:02:29 +0000 2015) $PBR beauty !!
(Fri Apr 24 14:01:44 +0000 2015) $CALI -- thanks for playin'
(Fri Apr 24 14:00:09 +0000 2015) $MCP .97s up
(Fri Apr 24 13:56:27 +0000 2015) $MCP gearing up
(Fri Apr 24 13:51:13 +0000 2015) $LOOK fooled me thought it may have a nice breakout/squeeze but nope -- terms matter I guess today
(Fri Apr 24 13:50:51 +0000 2015) All covered $VGGL and sold all $CLF gapper (and adds at open) -- nice start
(Fri Apr 24 13:48:10 +0000 2015) $CMGE check daily chart break out here if this move continues

(Fri Apr 24 13:35:47 +0000 2015) $CLF on $6 test
(Fri Apr 24 13:32:58 +0000 2015) $MSTX there she goes
(Fri Apr 24 13:26:53 +0000 2015) $AMCN nice start on the short -- (Apr 24-09:09) InvestorsLive: AMCN just had 20-F out w/ earnings negative reaction to it
(Fri Apr 24 13:19:50 +0000 2015) New blog post yesterday (also as @YngvaiMalmsteve pointed out - it's not just new traders - I (we) make them too) https://t.co/CvlB7kvR29
(Fri Apr 24 12:25:06 +0000 2015) @LBarkawi what do you need? The IU guy just had a baby so has been having a late start on chat -- but just submit a ticket I can help
(Fri Apr 24 12:21:14 +0000 2015) $CLF gapper working well so far :)
(Fri Apr 24 12:06:07 +0000 2015) $MSTX trading at a $2.50 discount to the Roth $3 price target ha, should be a fun one today chart risk of a few cents
(Fri Apr 24 10:21:57 +0000 2015) @YngvaiMalmsteve a very good point - I made some this week

(Thu Apr 23 19:54:06 +0000 2015) @GWR does anyone hold the world record for most $TWTR blocks or is @EpicaCapital currently the world record holder?
(Thu Apr 23 19:50:53 +0000 2015) $CALI = up b/c newsletter pump + short b/c no reason to be up + crowded short + not in this market + nHODs = NUTTY market

(Thu Apr 23 17:15:40 +0000 2015) And not that $USO will be power straight up but rather just feels like one day we wake up to a FAT gap -- ya know? just a guess is all
(Thu Apr 23 17:13:51 +0000 2015) $USO the type of trade you wake up and it's $22 I'm not trading it but I'm trading $PBR $CLF $DNR -- just feels like some crazy move coming

(Thu Apr 23 16:05:02 +0000 2015) @modern_rock when you count the number of shares @lx21 @dveprek were trading it makes that vol % impossible lol
(Thu Apr 23 15:53:51 +0000 2015) $CLF $DNR  nice trends forming along with $PBR $USO $XOP

(Thu Apr 23 15:37:55 +0000 2015) We may see some serious moves in oil to the upside if this hangs on ... or maybe a gap to $22 in coming days on $USO nice action

(Wed Apr 22 17:55:11 +0000 2015) $VGGL she lives! Nice rips

(Wed Apr 22 17:12:04 +0000 2015) The good news is @elkwood66 underwear from this morning will hit ebay shortly to the highest bidder http://t.co/Jage6cCkNx
(Wed Apr 22 17:10:01 +0000 2015) The point is not that you shouldn't be cautious re: @EpicaCapital tweet but this is what we do if it's there fuking do it A + set up
(Wed Apr 22 17:08:47 +0000 2015) One thing I took from @EpicaCapital at @Traders4ACause  was people's tendency to go small after a loss -- which is WRONG
(Wed Apr 22 17:03:45 +0000 2015) I've said this before -- ability of @DerrickJLeon @elkwood66 @OzarkTrades @Nikkorico_ INCREDIBLE guys -- well fuking done.
(Wed Apr 22 17:01:51 +0000 2015) Covered 1/2 $VLTC +$4.50-5 ... finally super nasty
(Wed Apr 22 16:52:27 +0000 2015) The days $LAKE and $DGLY cracked they closed near LODs fwiw ... $VLTC
(Wed Apr 22 16:44:49 +0000 2015) PRO TIP: ONLY TRADE when @lx21 margins off his mini-van to short $VLTC #PAYSBETTER
(Wed Apr 22 16:42:27 +0000 2015) $VLTC looks like hackers are fucking with the muststaygreen.exe code that's been running on it the past few days ...
(Wed Apr 22 16:38:40 +0000 2015) $QUNR killer fade
(Wed Apr 22 15:53:02 +0000 2015) Leave it to @d4ytrad3 to trade $MCD to pay for a Happy Meal
(Wed Apr 22 15:13:37 +0000 2015) $GBSN shoulda sold more than 1/3 up there was up $18k at $6 ... doh wanted to be patient on some just in case
(Wed Apr 22 14:58:32 +0000 2015) So wait yesterday people said $LOOK was the next $VLTC .. what happened?
(Wed Apr 22 14:46:02 +0000 2015) This answer is yes if a wash to $10 occurs LOL no otherwise  https://t.co/Hk5IxbGlYD
(Wed Apr 22 14:43:31 +0000 2015) $VLTC fundamentals MAY matter if it hits red ONLY lol
(Wed Apr 22 14:42:41 +0000 2015) @swedepilot LOL
(Wed Apr 22 14:41:55 +0000 2015) $VLTC thanks for playin'
(Wed Apr 22 14:38:57 +0000 2015) Took 1/3 $GBSN off +$1.20 trying to be patient on rest until change in trend
(Wed Apr 22 14:29:16 +0000 2015) Just acquired a SWEET mini-van at discounted price mad cheap some dude was selling it to add to $VLTC  ;) http://t.co/OQkKEDJGHz

(Wed Apr 22 14:12:40 +0000 2015) $JDST love that set up :) (Apr 22-10:01) InvestorsLive: JDST ABCDing
(Wed Apr 22 14:06:42 +0000 2015) $GBSN more bashes = more shorts = more traps = here we are HODs
(Wed Apr 22 14:03:38 +0000 2015) $CCIH hello there
(Wed Apr 22 13:56:54 +0000 2015) People still seem to think fundamentals matter in this market -- stocks are TRADING VEHICLES ONLY right now
(Wed Apr 22 13:56:32 +0000 2015) $GBSN is a super crowded short again -- lots of hit pieces on it lately -- def lock in along the way but awesome trade so far
(Wed Apr 22 13:55:41 +0000 2015) $VLTC reminds me of $LEXG back in day -- each morning they hold it trap shorts and squeeze out -- then let it grind
(Wed Apr 22 13:53:04 +0000 2015) $ADXS beauty !
(Wed Apr 22 13:48:38 +0000 2015) $LOOK trapped again low float and going for red/green .. sick market
(Wed Apr 22 13:40:10 +0000 2015) $GBSN super sick awesome call in chat http://t.co/dgy4TYvOIU
(Wed Apr 22 13:38:47 +0000 2015) $GBSN game time :)
(Wed Apr 22 13:37:26 +0000 2015) $VIMC too bad no vol nice off scan -- just needed more vol
(Wed Apr 22 13:36:09 +0000 2015) $VGGL slow bleed
(Wed Apr 22 13:21:24 +0000 2015) @PrePromoStocks Remember when AwesomePennyStocks announced a new pick coming only to be the same pick to trap shorts LOL
(Wed Apr 22 13:18:17 +0000 2015) The next $VLTC is ...................    (To Be Continued)
(Wed Apr 22 12:53:26 +0000 2015) By no means am I suggesting $VLTC is a long, I'm just reiterating this point I made 50% ago: https://t.co/FKIc6VvH6q
(Wed Apr 22 12:52:06 +0000 2015) What does that mean re: $VLTC ? There is no "panic" from SELLERS (cuz they've been rotated) it will only be AFTER they pull support
(Wed Apr 22 12:51:09 +0000 2015) Keep in mind re: $VLTC the float rotation thought - each level it's gone up as rotated the float and formed new base no one is left from low
(Wed Apr 22 12:50:40 +0000 2015) $VLTC I would expect a lot LESS volume today vs. yesterday, more .30-.50+ air pockets and ideally re-test of highs again for a fade later
(Wed Apr 22 12:50:01 +0000 2015) $VLTC usually after big pull back like yest $19 to $16 everyone thinks "Finally" then puts on a short, imo they retrapped $15.50-16s yest
(Wed Apr 22 12:19:28 +0000 2015) For those that missed last night re: Departure From Profit.ly https://t.co/H7xbRsPuAk

(Wed Apr 22 00:54:58 +0000 2015) Crazy how similiar this $VLTC was to the $DGLY $LAKE move when I did the video on float rotation ... nuts
(Wed Apr 22 00:52:15 +0000 2015) @natedaytrade @danshep55 I have a dog, does that count? As you can see I am strategically acquiring all my assets NOW per my rules
(Wed Apr 22 00:48:55 +0000 2015) @danshep55 I'll have a DVD out on marriage tips next -- @vandykeforbes has been asking me to make one for years
(Wed Apr 22 00:47:30 +0000 2015) @danshep55 see thats where you went wrong ;) married guys making man cave / bar / wine cellar / TV / gym #learn http://t.co/F6WATEBi9P

(Tue Apr 21 23:43:06 +0000 2015) @MichaelGorbaty @WhiteCoatMafia Shares are very easy to borrow via a simple locate -- too easy I had to hold back lol
(Tue Apr 21 23:40:06 +0000 2015) @crawfish_poboy @stock_choices not a good pic for the younger audience like @Nikkorico_ to see beer + keys in your hand #beresponsible
(Tue Apr 21 23:38:26 +0000 2015) I think I said that on $DGLY and $LAKE though -- I mean I know when to warn trades to be careful but yet can't get long #needtoworkonthat
(Tue Apr 21 23:35:30 +0000 2015) @RobScozzafava should go higher or lower from here imo
(Tue Apr 21 23:35:16 +0000 2015) And I swear -- one time ... next time? Instead of just calling for $15-17 at $10 on $VLTC I'll actually get long LOL #oneday #goals
(Tue Apr 21 23:26:51 +0000 2015) The other thing is there are SO many things running -- FOCUS is the key remember: https://t.co/DYyFKh15mB don't try to nail ALL
(Tue Apr 21 23:23:05 +0000 2015) For EOD moves and momentum continuation looking for the set ups like $LOOK compare that to $VLTC past few days higher lows grind and boom
(Tue Apr 21 23:22:24 +0000 2015) Typically my BEST trades are reacting straight out of gate to stuff like $BIOC gap para on $4 sit back but this week thru me off for sure
(Tue Apr 21 23:20:40 +0000 2015) I'd say my best trades came 10AM + this week joining trend and my worst trades came BEFORE 10AM reacting &amp; anticipating
(Tue Apr 21 23:19:24 +0000 2015) Also $APPY was just joining the trend vs. trying to anticipate out of the gate -- works in some markets not in these
(Tue Apr 21 23:18:56 +0000 2015) I joined $VGGL $CAPN $LOOK moves today and worked well (also faded $LOOK mid day) and joined $HZNP trend down
(Tue Apr 21 23:18:16 +0000 2015) I think the biggest thing right now is not to try to predict the moves but rather just join them on dips w/ a set risk
(Tue Apr 21 23:17:56 +0000 2015) $NYMX Got a mid $1.5x's entry ended up bailing low $1.4x's but will be eyeing in case something like $ENZN happens
(Tue Apr 21 23:17:23 +0000 2015) No such dice, @elkwood66 @Nikkorico_ nailed $BIOC short I tried it twice long but respected stops both times (which saved me)
(Tue Apr 21 23:16:58 +0000 2015) Told myself I'd be less biased today since we've had some major runners lately and wanted to give $BIOC $NYMX a chance for a second day

(Tue Apr 21 22:56:03 +0000 2015) $COOL getting smacked more AHs
(Tue Apr 21 20:40:03 +0000 2015) @XavierSalvador4 you cannot use $VLTC + $VGGL + fundamentals in the same sentence
(Tue Apr 21 19:59:50 +0000 2015) $APPY nice close
(Tue Apr 21 19:59:44 +0000 2015) Covered $VLTC here
(Tue Apr 21 19:57:14 +0000 2015) There's $HZNP -- doh
(Tue Apr 21 19:50:06 +0000 2015) $APPY there it is :) holding this one over as well (partial) possible gapper
(Tue Apr 21 19:49:24 +0000 2015) @Stunnajam7 wasn't a short idea be careful
(Tue Apr 21 19:49:15 +0000 2015) Def locking SOME into this move on $LOOK -- reality is it's just a short squeezer nothing more but best to pay yourself along way
(Tue Apr 21 19:48:26 +0000 2015) $LOOK ba da bing
(Tue Apr 21 19:46:34 +0000 2015) $QUNR nearing $50 mag
(Tue Apr 21 19:43:43 +0000 2015) All done with $HZNP might snap but was patient for most of the day
(Tue Apr 21 19:40:39 +0000 2015) I was waiting for the @lx21 tweet "Stepped in from vacation put on a few $NDRM short at $19" tweet for $VLTC .. WTF bro I woulda loaded lol
(Tue Apr 21 19:39:39 +0000 2015) $APPY push back towards highs
(Tue Apr 21 19:38:25 +0000 2015) @Nikkorico_ AWESOME MAN !!
(Tue Apr 21 19:38:20 +0000 2015) RT @Nikkorico_: All covered $BIOC. Good day at work, I avoided VLTC completely for once. http://t.co/OtnoBtWwbc
(Tue Apr 21 19:37:25 +0000 2015) $BIOC slam -- nice one @elkwood66 @Nikkorico_ good calls today
(Tue Apr 21 19:33:08 +0000 2015) Always thought it'd be funny when I scalp this $VLTC short for .10-1.00 or something stupid only to realize it's up $8 HAHA
(Tue Apr 21 19:32:37 +0000 2015) $VLTC I am up 3 cents per share !!
(Tue Apr 21 19:31:46 +0000 2015) $LOOK likely a float rotation squeezer into tomorrow possible gapper won't chase but eyeing dips
(Tue Apr 21 19:20:18 +0000 2015) Back to back 900-1m+ 5 minute candles on this $VLTC -- whomever caused this run likely just go covered, now for the next guy
(Tue Apr 21 19:15:30 +0000 2015) That allows you to take the noise out of "Woah its up $7 bucks" treat it like a $1.70 stock you'd want a $2.20 breakout right? (ie: $22)
(Tue Apr 21 19:15:03 +0000 2015) What I told my chat bit ago when trading this $VLTC (treat it like a $1.50 stock going towards $2) use same risk/ideas you would if $1.xx
(Tue Apr 21 19:13:24 +0000 2015) At this point I'm surprised $LAKE and $DGLY didn't double on $VLTC sympathy LOL
(Tue Apr 21 19:06:25 +0000 2015) Have $HZNP small s/s left $APPY long left for gapper (prob) and partial $NYMX left (sold 1/2 for loss so far didn't get the rally I thought)
(Tue Apr 21 19:00:19 +0000 2015) $VLTC both at $15 and $16 no large volume bars anymore -- no one is left long just shorts and whomever is holding the float lol
(Tue Apr 21 18:56:33 +0000 2015) $ADXS nice breakout already back on $22 !! Likely trapped shorts nicely on that filing out the other night super nice - hope it gets $25+
(Tue Apr 21 18:52:09 +0000 2015) I put a wish order on $VLTC this AM just in case it got wild out of the gate $15.79 for short -- just pulled it LOL
(Tue Apr 21 18:48:16 +0000 2015) QUESTION: Once $VLTC ends what are you going to do with all the time you get back from not watching every tick? lol
(Tue Apr 21 18:46:01 +0000 2015) Big props to @stock_choices on his day -- best day ever usually a slow/steady grinder awesome job buddy, congrats.
(Tue Apr 21 18:42:07 +0000 2015) RT @stock_choices: Best day ever now thanks $BIOC
(Tue Apr 21 18:27:50 +0000 2015) $LOOK out below ;)
(Tue Apr 21 18:20:04 +0000 2015) $VLTC this grind should look familiar -- same thing past 7 days now lol the only difference is everyone thinks next time will be different
(Tue Apr 21 18:14:42 +0000 2015) @mattzcat @GorkaHabib @kroyrunner89 that wasn't the point -- point was float rotation
(Tue Apr 21 17:55:02 +0000 2015) This $LOOK can still snap another .20-.30 cents before EOD imo -- but paying myself along the way
(Tue Apr 21 17:54:39 +0000 2015) Locked some $LOOK +.45 -- nice one guys
(Tue Apr 21 17:48:46 +0000 2015) $APPY nice rip
(Tue Apr 21 17:43:25 +0000 2015) Finally $LOOK cracking from re shorts in chat $1.97-2.04s .... took long enough ...
(Tue Apr 21 17:38:11 +0000 2015) @ivarjed just PM me in the chat room if questions thanks
(Tue Apr 21 17:36:48 +0000 2015) $APPY nice rip nothing to chase but I am watching dips for EOD possible gapper nice trend intraday
(Tue Apr 21 16:58:38 +0000 2015) $CAPN re-test
(Tue Apr 21 16:56:19 +0000 2015) @EpicaCapital Undervalued hidden gem !! Wait til people find out about it !! ;)
(Tue Apr 21 16:54:46 +0000 2015) $NYMX perk ... $BIOC perk
(Tue Apr 21 16:21:52 +0000 2015) $LOOK ideally those who didn't cover into the wash give us another opp to get short higher - stubborn traders fuel the rally
(Tue Apr 21 16:07:26 +0000 2015) @DuaneWP I short at $1.87-1.88 if you missed and have covereed some into the 1.5x-6xs pull back
(Tue Apr 21 16:01:11 +0000 2015) @cfl5855 HOD list by @dastrader
(Tue Apr 21 15:54:50 +0000 2015) $LOOK still thin so far held well was hoping for more watching this next push $1.80-1.90s if it fails should crack if not - I'll wait
(Tue Apr 21 15:47:04 +0000 2015) Went short on $LOOK $1.87-1.88 for cover into washout ideally $1.40-1.50
(Tue Apr 21 15:42:53 +0000 2015) $CAPN $8 test here -- nice $1/share move so far for us -- still thinking $8-10 possible not sure if I'll make it that far tho lol
(Tue Apr 21 15:38:38 +0000 2015) I'm not bashing $LOOK but if you're buying it as next $VLTC watch how far you chase lol -- best of luck sick rip so far
(Tue Apr 21 15:33:15 +0000 2015) lol another day another runner $LOOK -- I mean .. geez this market ha
(Tue Apr 21 15:21:30 +0000 2015) Isn't it amazing when the price of a stock last week becomes the range for the day? LOL $VLTC #nuts
(Tue Apr 21 15:18:06 +0000 2015) What better way to explain $VLTC this past week: https://t.co/yhkcKKWRin @modern_rock
(Tue Apr 21 15:17:20 +0000 2015) $HZNP 112th time the charm?
(Tue Apr 21 15:06:02 +0000 2015) @Nikkorico_ @stock_choices nice job guys -- great reads I tried to adapt to the long idea but lost .12-15 both times -- doh
(Tue Apr 21 15:02:59 +0000 2015) @stock_choices nice trade!
(Tue Apr 21 15:01:28 +0000 2015) $BIOC no go, $3.80s put up a nice defense for a while which got me interested but $3.60s didn't hold
(Tue Apr 21 14:52:16 +0000 2015) SUPER call by @offshorehunters on $CAPN it on my radar $7 and that's where I got the idea for chat from - AWESOME job http://t.co/AAbZWEbZGu
(Tue Apr 21 14:47:48 +0000 2015) $VGGL lil bit more
(Tue Apr 21 14:44:27 +0000 2015) $CAPN doing what $CAPN does
(Tue Apr 21 14:33:12 +0000 2015) $BIOC that $3.80 feels like it's secretly soaking whomever wants to sell wouldn't be surprised to see this on highs later but risk off .60s
(Tue Apr 21 14:31:50 +0000 2015) $KITE with $JUNO
(Tue Apr 21 14:31:33 +0000 2015) $JUNO nice rip on PR
(Tue Apr 21 14:25:20 +0000 2015) Have 1/4 $VGGL left
(Tue Apr 21 14:22:49 +0000 2015) $VLTC for those that short at $13 ... now they get to meet $15 -- ridiculous move this is super nasty $DGLY $LAKE style #floatrotation
(Tue Apr 21 14:22:12 +0000 2015) $VGGL like butttaaahhh
(Tue Apr 21 14:19:55 +0000 2015) $BIOC $VGGL nice ramps after finding support eyeing $NYMX for red/green rip as well risk LODs (once I have a few adds still looking dips)
(Tue Apr 21 14:12:30 +0000 2015) $JUNO nice off scan ... straight down off morning ramp
(Tue Apr 21 14:11:08 +0000 2015) $VLTC re trapped again -- amazing to watch this $LAKE 2.0
(Tue Apr 21 14:04:17 +0000 2015) $JUNO red
(Tue Apr 21 13:51:49 +0000 2015) $VGGL lil mo
(Tue Apr 21 13:47:30 +0000 2015) $VLTC ideally $13-15 blow off move
(Tue Apr 21 13:43:04 +0000 2015) $CYTR nice off dips .. $AMPE nice so far
(Tue Apr 21 13:39:18 +0000 2015) $VLTC this is a punishing move
(Tue Apr 21 13:35:59 +0000 2015) $COOL thru $2
(Tue Apr 21 13:31:58 +0000 2015) $BIOC sweet gapper
(Tue Apr 21 13:29:37 +0000 2015) Traders get in the mindset it "has to pull back" .. shew nice gap -- good luck all today $VLTC
(Tue Apr 21 13:29:13 +0000 2015) $VLTC is CARBON COPY what cost @kroyrunner89 a ton in the past if you recall on $LAKE -- nice work staying safe this round Tim
(Tue Apr 21 13:28:12 +0000 2015) $VLTC to those tweeting me yesterday -- this is what I meant by beginning of punishing move - the speed up factor: https://t.co/vSEVfBGp4z
(Tue Apr 21 13:23:10 +0000 2015) $VLTC finally starting to speed up
(Tue Apr 21 12:08:56 +0000 2015) Once @muddywatersre wakes up this morning boy is he going to love the $NQ news he wakes up to -- CEO resign #nailincoffin

(Tue Apr 21 00:26:08 +0000 2015) @AhabibAhmed not it hasn't it's been a slow and steady squeeze -- where was the blow off move?
(Mon Apr 20 20:19:34 +0000 2015) Like I said last week sometimes when you're to focused watching the one everyone wants the easy money slips right by $ZIOP $KITE $JUNO
(Mon Apr 20 20:19:34 +0000 2015) Like I said last week sometimes when you're to focused watching the one everyone wants the easy money slips right by $ZIOP $KITE $JUNO
(Mon Apr 20 20:16:48 +0000 2015) @jmsnowshill when was I short ? A week or two ago on a day trade ? Comon now
(Mon Apr 20 20:13:54 +0000 2015) @Cuda987 it's up because a short squeeze .. period not fundamental .. so can end as soon as any squeeze done
(Mon Apr 20 20:06:20 +0000 2015) @BullZoneTrader hey at least you tried LOL I should have each time it was setting up
(Mon Apr 20 20:05:36 +0000 2015) Props to @BullZoneTrader tho he got long on $VLTC off the dips -- nice trade -- I just watched lol
(Mon Apr 20 20:03:40 +0000 2015) @Cuda987 easy to say after right? How'd that work on $GENE at $11?
(Mon Apr 20 20:03:03 +0000 2015) Thing about $VLTC there has been no "punishing move" hence the warnings we need that parabolic action and heavy volume when they roast all
(Mon Apr 20 20:00:54 +0000 2015) $VLTC I guess we hope for $12 to $15 at this point? I mean -- this slow grind thing is killing me waiting -- we need a blow off move
(Mon Apr 20 19:59:02 +0000 2015) $BIOC big close
(Mon Apr 20 19:56:17 +0000 2015) $MEIP nice close
(Mon Apr 20 19:47:40 +0000 2015) Took last bits of $CHOP off $4.08-4.12 -- lacking vol and too thin now -- was over weekend $3.85-4s avg -- took loss re think about it later
(Mon Apr 20 19:41:34 +0000 2015) $CRMD saved
(Mon Apr 20 19:41:21 +0000 2015) Headline and rumor buyers are at all time highs recent examples: $IMMU $VLTC
(Mon Apr 20 19:40:04 +0000 2015) Meanwhile $VLTC has nothing to do with any of it -- but it def worked since every short is timid right now
(Mon Apr 20 19:39:30 +0000 2015) $VLTC the ticker wasn't on but people spun it as a positive since $GOOG is rolling out some stuff tomorrow -- anything to cause a stir ...
(Mon Apr 20 19:38:19 +0000 2015) $GENE thanks for playin'
(Mon Apr 20 19:37:49 +0000 2015) Now that CNBC got all the dumb retail in on $VLTC at least we know we're about 1-2 days away from the peak lol
(Mon Apr 20 19:33:42 +0000 2015) @BioRunUp sellers &gt; buyers
(Mon Apr 20 19:33:00 +0000 2015) $IMMU halted
(Mon Apr 20 19:32:55 +0000 2015) $IMMU umm ...
(Mon Apr 20 19:31:53 +0000 2015) $ROSG there she goes
(Mon Apr 20 19:30:56 +0000 2015) $VLTC lol, glad CNBC didn't mentioned $2 $4 $6 or $8 .. yes, $10 makes more sense to start yapping about it
(Mon Apr 20 19:17:15 +0000 2015) $ROSG likely going to hold this one over again finally nice hold $4.20s is the spot we've been talking about for days that needs to break
(Mon Apr 20 19:15:32 +0000 2015) @NailAndBail lol, can't fix stooopid
(Mon Apr 20 19:01:00 +0000 2015) @BlatantBull is that what you were asking? If confused just look at the intraday chart
(Mon Apr 20 18:44:30 +0000 2015) $ROSG finally ...
(Mon Apr 20 18:31:23 +0000 2015) $JUNO how thy mighty have fallen .. sheww
(Mon Apr 20 18:05:59 +0000 2015) @BlatantBull http://t.co/oXVFQlYt01
(Mon Apr 20 18:03:58 +0000 2015) Really glad $VLTC was hard to borrow at most of the firms that cater to smaller traders - we probably would have lost 1/2 of them
(Mon Apr 20 18:03:40 +0000 2015) Does the comments rather be .10-.20 late than $1-2 early make more sense in staying safe in this market re: $VLTC ?
(Mon Apr 20 17:52:04 +0000 2015) $VGGL example of this market -- ramps up one day .. fades back then boom ... nothing company wise just buyers &gt; sellers/shorts + squeeze
(Mon Apr 20 17:43:48 +0000 2015) $AMPE slowly does it -- only thing I don't like is SSR is on so washes out fast but trying to be patient for ramp back on $3+
(Mon Apr 20 17:33:02 +0000 2015) @MicrocapTrading so what you're saying is it'll trade the float today -- again lol
(Mon Apr 20 17:26:19 +0000 2015) $VIMC bit more HODs
(Mon Apr 20 16:58:26 +0000 2015) @EpicaCapital talk about a rail job
(Mon Apr 20 16:34:46 +0000 2015) Missed some great longs today - but doing a good job of sitting on hands on things I want to short better to be late than way early
(Mon Apr 20 16:34:21 +0000 2015) $BIOC nice alert @markflowchatter in chat real early
(Mon Apr 20 16:08:07 +0000 2015) $ONCY steady from gapper idea Friday
(Mon Apr 20 15:06:35 +0000 2015) $GENE well, nice trade but covered 2 seconds before this next leg down ha
(Mon Apr 20 14:45:43 +0000 2015) @modern_rock did you bid on it?
(Mon Apr 20 14:41:21 +0000 2015) $ROSG gearing up
(Mon Apr 20 14:41:16 +0000 2015) $VLTC only place I care about it is if $9.40 cracks and holds
(Mon Apr 20 14:37:06 +0000 2015) $VLTC negative: http://t.co/B8HUp6j7jA
(Mon Apr 20 14:35:08 +0000 2015) $GENE they squeezed out the pre market shorts and early shorts -- then re shorts w/ risk prior tops has worked so far
(Mon Apr 20 14:22:33 +0000 2015) $FNRG halted
(Mon Apr 20 14:07:42 +0000 2015) This market is SILLY -- just wow no sellers $NYMX straight up super craaaazy -- I don't trust any shorts of any size in current conditions
(Mon Apr 20 14:04:14 +0000 2015) $NYMX  massive move
(Mon Apr 20 14:00:01 +0000 2015) Tried $AMPE on the wash to start --  wanted to scale in but so far waiting for nHODs -- this can bleed all day won't add to loser w/o trend
(Mon Apr 20 13:59:32 +0000 2015) $CRMD sub $8
(Mon Apr 20 13:41:19 +0000 2015) $ONCY nice gapper idea!
(Mon Apr 20 13:41:14 +0000 2015) $VIMC straight up off scan play
(Mon Apr 20 13:40:40 +0000 2015) $HZNP nice fades out of the gate
(Mon Apr 20 13:29:57 +0000 2015) @sgravalox we are rebooting it
(Mon Apr 20 13:02:50 +0000 2015) I remember this day in history ... this is the day all the cool kids went to school with beat red eyes blazed outta their minds LOL 4/20

(Fri Apr 17 22:31:17 +0000 2015) @BioRunUp so are you a pumper or a basher, I'm confused.
(Fri Apr 17 22:26:25 +0000 2015) $VLTC how low can she go AHs? should be fun to watch into the close -- pre mature breakout into close squeezed 'em out
(Fri Apr 17 22:25:28 +0000 2015) @stock_choices @swedepilot his wife only makes him Salmon now so he has to eat out a lot

(Fri Apr 17 19:34:27 +0000 2015) $ONCY possible gapper for .80-.85 + if it closes well
(Fri Apr 17 19:31:09 +0000 2015) $CHOP faded right back off that $4 para .. $3.70s or lower holds I'll hold it short over night
(Fri Apr 17 19:05:29 +0000 2015) $WUBA range incredible

(Fri Apr 17 14:02:18 +0000 2015) By no means am I saying buy $GBSN I am long earlier risk on $3.60s but more of a warning to shorts to have a PLAN don't just "hold to hold"
(Fri Apr 17 14:01:39 +0000 2015) $GBSN key level is $4.20 and $4.40 for breakout -- don't be surprised if this runs 50% -- be careful if short
(Fri Apr 17 13:57:10 +0000 2015) $GBSN took long enough - maybe a Friday squeezer to $5s
(Fri Apr 17 13:52:55 +0000 2015) $WUBA moment of silence for the shorts please

(Fri Apr 17 00:12:45 +0000 2015) @stocwach @GorkaHabib I address good and bad issues as I trade you're comments are not real life - stop tweeting me nonsense - 2nd request
(Fri Apr 17 00:09:31 +0000 2015) @crawfish_poboy same lol
(Thu Apr 16 21:32:16 +0000 2015) @Nikkorico_ 100% exactly couldn't have said better myself
(Thu Apr 16 21:32:05 +0000 2015) RT @Nikkorico_: Trading has been consuming more and more mental energy the last few days. Good in some ways, bad in others. But it'll all b…
(Thu Apr 16 20:49:28 +0000 2015) Now onto more important things http://t.co/RpHuVq11hB
(Thu Apr 16 20:48:50 +0000 2015) One other thing .. you don't always have to trade the stocks everyone is .. focus on YOU it'll help you
(Thu Apr 16 20:38:59 +0000 2015) When momo stocks turn only chasers &amp; emotional covers happen ... put yourself on other side for optimal entries .. like $CHOP today
(Thu Apr 16 20:38:29 +0000 2015) Market is thin right now just shorts &amp; no sellers .. stepping over each other
(Thu Apr 16 20:33:51 +0000 2015) Don't be stubborn on way up because when it's FINALLY time you're going to be too scared to play
(Thu Apr 16 20:32:29 +0000 2015) We have some game changing plays coming soon it's going to be awesome it's just about being there for it
(Thu Apr 16 20:31:50 +0000 2015) Market changing so fast lately and names fuel off one another like crazy .. finally get my patience down and then I don't need it ha
(Thu Apr 16 20:31:08 +0000 2015) Point of tweets is not bitching about the market ... it's unreal right now point is respect the trend and most importantly ALWAYS ADAPT
(Thu Apr 16 20:29:46 +0000 2015) Then you've got one day hero stocks like $NVGN and next day you can't get a pulse
(Thu Apr 16 20:29:12 +0000 2015) Some of the moves you don't really have a choice because if you're not locking in as soon as they turn they rip $0.40 against you
(Thu Apr 16 20:27:11 +0000 2015) And the better news is the more they hold the more opportunity there is the next day
(Thu Apr 16 20:26:55 +0000 2015) Guess the good news is the plays are there you just have to take the money when they wash and not be patient
(Thu Apr 16 20:25:58 +0000 2015) Frustrating day was up $20k at one point and minimized to an average day ... not enough patience than too much patience lol market is nuts
(Thu Apr 16 19:51:33 +0000 2015) Minimized another major day but part of trading but still good -- no sellers in this market just shorts and holders gotta be 1 step ahead
(Thu Apr 16 19:50:44 +0000 2015) $FNRG I mean wow that'll learn ya
(Thu Apr 16 19:41:38 +0000 2015) $ADRO another $2 buck wash, covered like a rookie damnit
(Thu Apr 16 19:39:44 +0000 2015) @stock_choices it was easy bro just long at $2 and sell at $9 ... not sure what was so difficult? ;)
(Thu Apr 16 19:26:57 +0000 2015) $VGGL I lost patience took it off $1.99 from $2.30s nice trade guys
(Thu Apr 16 19:25:57 +0000 2015) @swedepilot now get me some entries on the rips lol
(Thu Apr 16 19:25:49 +0000 2015) RT @swedepilot: $CHOP curl trade brought to you by @InvestorsLive new warning service.  When he warns we BANK.  lol
(Thu Apr 16 19:25:01 +0000 2015) The good news though is technical analysis is working more than perfectly - check $CHOP at $3.70 as mentioned over/under and grind
(Thu Apr 16 19:21:54 +0000 2015) Remember just because its easy to borrow doesn't make it a good short
(Thu Apr 16 19:21:41 +0000 2015) We have to thank them because they are ignoring trend changes and offering better entry opportunities but please be careful out there
(Thu Apr 16 19:18:59 +0000 2015) This market is fueled by shorts who short things because they are "up" and have no real plan of risk -- all emotional moves
(Thu Apr 16 19:14:50 +0000 2015) $CHOP held those $3.70s well that I mentioned was the spot to watch -- so far using that as guide or any good push for add
(Thu Apr 16 19:04:09 +0000 2015) $NFLX dipless straight up
(Thu Apr 16 19:03:45 +0000 2015) Even $AMCN perking back
(Thu Apr 16 18:53:05 +0000 2015) Covered down to 1/4 of $ADRO nice fader off the highs
(Thu Apr 16 18:49:39 +0000 2015) What a crazy market huh? Incredible every dip bought on the momo's
(Thu Apr 16 18:22:25 +0000 2015) Read $ROSG wrong today I should have waited for the $4.20s to hold earlier vs. anticipating - happens
(Thu Apr 16 18:03:27 +0000 2015) Nice work @TomKellyLV @shaneblackmon on this $ATHX fader -- great read gentlemen
(Thu Apr 16 17:45:02 +0000 2015) http://t.co/6dlXtooTbq - Posted a New Webinar: 4/16 Webinar Member Q and A
(Thu Apr 16 17:44:35 +0000 2015) $VGGL testing my patience for sure -- but working well !!
(Thu Apr 16 17:39:49 +0000 2015) We get another chance on $VLTC all the chase shorts into lows now we gotta work them out ... amazing staying power
(Thu Apr 16 17:37:19 +0000 2015) $CHOP just as we ordered !! Squeezed everyone into $3.80s dumb $$ and then slam back down
(Thu Apr 16 17:36:07 +0000 2015) $TPLM yes sir
(Thu Apr 16 17:17:22 +0000 2015) If you ever get a "RST" on your @GeekDesk here is what you need to do: https://t.co/MEHkzUBMI1 just happened to me
(Thu Apr 16 17:08:48 +0000 2015) Hopefully some late chasers and late shorts get squeezed on $CHOP so we can get some adds into pops from covers -- $3.70 is spot to watch
(Thu Apr 16 16:29:48 +0000 2015) $MCP ooops
(Thu Apr 16 16:18:01 +0000 2015) $USO super rips
(Thu Apr 16 16:07:20 +0000 2015) $ADRO $43 test!
(Thu Apr 16 15:58:46 +0000 2015) $VLTC obviously lock in along way to reduce emotions but typically the biggest washes come after the initial snap
(Thu Apr 16 15:56:11 +0000 2015) $ADRO ut oh
(Thu Apr 16 15:54:10 +0000 2015) $CHOP its up 30% $3.80s ... been shorting into $3.90-4.10s and think that it could end red - will cover on way down or if grinds
(Thu Apr 16 15:54:10 +0000 2015) $CHOP its up 30% $3.80s ... been shorting into $3.90-4.10s and think that it could end red - will cover on way down or if grinds
(Thu Apr 16 15:51:50 +0000 2015) $TPLM love the daily chart
(Thu Apr 16 15:48:48 +0000 2015) $ROSG thought this may have some legs so far I'm wrong have low $4.20s avg and bagging it - figured late day move after $4 over/under
(Thu Apr 16 15:47:06 +0000 2015) $VLTC everyone says hmmm RED !! short $8.40 ... then freak out cover $8.60-.70 -- this is why ENTRY is EVERYTHING #patience on pops
(Thu Apr 16 15:45:19 +0000 2015) $VLTC everyone shorts into weakness which keeps it up, once traders figure that out it'll drop until then dumb chasers keep propping it up
(Thu Apr 16 15:43:53 +0000 2015) $VLTC near red $8.40 is the trigger from earlier if it snaps .... REACH FOR IT !! http://t.co/g8ei0qyszS
(Thu Apr 16 15:37:15 +0000 2015) QUESTION: If $VLTC falls in a forest does it make a sound? What do you guys think? Does it bounce after hitting ground or stay stuck? #thump
(Thu Apr 16 15:17:32 +0000 2015) $VLTC remember staying out of the grind and just reacting or waiting for confirmations keep emotions out of the trade
(Thu Apr 16 15:17:14 +0000 2015) $VLTC the area of interest now is $8.80s  for me I need to see that peak out and confirm as top
(Thu Apr 16 15:03:34 +0000 2015) In full disclosure the last one only tanked 70% the next day not 90% ;)  $THCZ $VLTC tomorrow should be interesting  https://t.co/Ux6niWhED8
(Thu Apr 16 15:02:59 +0000 2015) Super snap on $ADRO -- perfect shorts -- now we need one more snap to make me super happy
(Thu Apr 16 14:42:04 +0000 2015) $VGGL looking for $1.80s still on other 1/2
(Thu Apr 16 14:39:40 +0000 2015) $VGGL LODs ...
(Thu Apr 16 14:36:36 +0000 2015) $CHOP will NOT end well -- when it finally dies
(Thu Apr 16 14:32:02 +0000 2015) $NVGN straight sell off
(Thu Apr 16 14:29:26 +0000 2015) $CHNR blast from past
(Thu Apr 16 14:23:10 +0000 2015) $BCLI nice ramp from weak open r/g
(Thu Apr 16 14:20:15 +0000 2015) $ADRO super nasty stuff into $50s -- shew wish I didn't start small before 2nd entry was sick but only good for break even
(Thu Apr 16 14:03:11 +0000 2015) RT @angelin_guraj: @InvestorsLive nice one Nate http://t.co/45yIFW7kgA still in 1/4
(Thu Apr 16 14:00:46 +0000 2015) $AMCN volume told the story just like the video lesson last night - shit is being tucked away
(Thu Apr 16 13:59:39 +0000 2015) RT @swedepilot: $ADRO perfect call in chat from @InvestorsLive warning everyone to stay safe can go to 45 in one candle.  It took a couple …
(Thu Apr 16 13:59:24 +0000 2015) $AMCN beauty
(Thu Apr 16 13:57:35 +0000 2015) $AMRN HODs $4.50 test
(Thu Apr 16 13:48:23 +0000 2015) $CHOP higher the better for the short -- what a squeezer
(Thu Apr 16 13:46:29 +0000 2015) $AMCN nice -- lower volume holding all dips and nearing r/g again for breakout squeeze again
(Thu Apr 16 13:42:18 +0000 2015) $ROSG I think can re-test highs in a bit guess we'll see
(Thu Apr 16 13:40:48 +0000 2015) $VGGL thanks for them morning rush :) $1.80s possible if it can't hold on at $2.10s
(Thu Apr 16 13:38:46 +0000 2015) Covered some $ADRO +$2.50-60/share nice one out of the gate
(Thu Apr 16 13:38:23 +0000 2015) Out $MCP gapper -- well done nice nearly 20% gapper
(Thu Apr 16 12:07:40 +0000 2015) $ADXS oops nice gap down
(Thu Apr 16 11:02:23 +0000 2015) @ReganEra_Stacks there isn't 365 trading days year :(

(Wed Apr 15 23:36:36 +0000 2015) @Banza9Lives we offer educational courses http://t.co/RHRP8C3h26
(Wed Apr 15 23:30:32 +0000 2015) Super pumped about my patience on $ADXS today took a lot to do, locking in on first wash helped but finally paid off nicely
(Wed Apr 15 23:28:07 +0000 2015) @kroyrunner89 You need more monitors in your office bro, keep the heat in and prevents freezing ;)
(Wed Apr 15 23:26:39 +0000 2015) Stocks with such range you cannot trade any size on especially first day -- even tomorrow I'll be trading SMALL size then add to winner ONLY
(Wed Apr 15 23:26:09 +0000 2015) $ADRO started high $39s added into the $41 push ended up w/ high $40s avg covered some $40 wash but got caught w/ other 1/2 covered $41 push
(Wed Apr 15 23:24:46 +0000 2015) $ADRO $44s after hours sickness -- I want $45-50 tomorrow for some good action tomorrow we'll see

(Wed Apr 15 20:08:38 +0000 2015) Bad ass call @mcuban on his $NFLX buy
(Wed Apr 15 19:59:50 +0000 2015) $ADRO nice -- washout followed by a rip ...   even better for tomorrow
(Wed Apr 15 19:58:26 +0000 2015) $VLTC .25 more cents and 2 minutes to give it up - can it do it? lol
(Wed Apr 15 19:57:03 +0000 2015) $VGGL 1 day wonder and gap down?
(Wed Apr 15 19:54:20 +0000 2015) I'm covering fast flush on $ADRO and then I am hopeful for $5 more parabolic upside tomorrow :) followed by a $3-5 pull back
(Wed Apr 15 19:53:58 +0000 2015) Scaled into $ADRO into the  $40-41 rip short for a quick short on profit taking into the close
(Wed Apr 15 19:52:32 +0000 2015) Snap goes the low float squeezer market lol
(Wed Apr 15 19:47:09 +0000 2015) $VLTC nutty action -- slap
(Wed Apr 15 19:45:30 +0000 2015) $GBSN impressive hold all day will do the same tomorrow if $3.80s holds I'll be buying dips for possible squeezer until trend breaks
(Wed Apr 15 19:09:13 +0000 2015) $ADRO only in this market
(Wed Apr 15 19:07:51 +0000 2015) $VGGL nice fader (Apr 15-14:51) InvestorsLive: started short VGGL so far using HODs as guide
(Wed Apr 15 18:56:13 +0000 2015) $CHOP shew baby this market is 100% fueled by shorts it's insane
(Wed Apr 15 18:51:50 +0000 2015) $CLF awesome !! nHODs
(Wed Apr 15 18:42:40 +0000 2015) Ideal trade on $VGGL is a stuff move into HODs then fade off -- if it keeps going TOMORROW is going to be insane
(Wed Apr 15 18:42:21 +0000 2015) $VGGL key area for later is $2.20s over it -- reactive trades ONLY under it ... pops for s/s -- until then be careful if still short
(Wed Apr 15 18:31:45 +0000 2015) $ZAAP not like the old days, too bad two times in past .08 to .25 then .08 to .45 all in about 10 minutes lol
(Wed Apr 15 18:31:10 +0000 2015) Awesome trade $WSTI fade @lx21 @splendores what a slam off the .40s

(Wed Apr 15 16:52:11 +0000 2015) $VLTC just a TIP for those who are fighting short -- be careful with the "well ... I'll just hold can't go much higher right?" theory
(Wed Apr 15 16:51:44 +0000 2015) $VGGL awesome nail in chat into the $2.30s + push towards $2.40

(Tue Apr 14 18:18:19 +0000 2015) They are still trash but currently in this market they are popping, consolidating to trap, crack reclaim support squeeze rinse and repeat
(Tue Apr 14 18:17:55 +0000 2015) Thing about a market and constantly adapting been a lot more long biased lately vs. shorts on these pigs

(Tue Apr 14 15:07:06 +0000 2015) If $VLTC ramps thru $7-7.20s .. $GBSN will ramp thru $4.50s too imo
(Tue Apr 14 15:06:00 +0000 2015) $VLTC there's the $6.80 break

(Tue Apr 14 14:23:08 +0000 2015) @BSlanina disagree man - he has had some great multi month moves takes a lot to call those -- best of luck to you
(Tue Apr 14 14:10:09 +0000 2015) $VLTC key area = $6.80 and $GBSN key area = $4.40
(Tue Apr 14 14:09:00 +0000 2015) $ORMP faster now straight off scan .. nHODs
(Tue Apr 14 14:06:21 +0000 2015) @SleemStockPicks haven't short it bud looking for long dips risk $6.50s if $6.80s bid starts to support but so far hasn't

(Tue Apr 14 11:55:05 +0000 2015) @AtlantisWade love that arm chair quarterback trader preaching you lol. Apparently with his strategy you short top cover bottom ALWAYS
(Tue Apr 14 11:42:25 +0000 2015) @stocwach @crawfish_poboy no more tweeting nonsense I will report to $TWTR to make you go away if continues - it's clear you haven't a clue
(Tue Apr 14 11:41:38 +0000 2015) @stocwach @crawfish_poboy trade management is why it was a good trade. Minimizing gains happens daily as you'll realize when u begin trading
(Tue Apr 14 11:39:55 +0000 2015) @AtlantisWade @NickEatsALot also  @stocwach more u tweet the more it's shown you're an armchair trader please stop sharing nonsense to me
(Tue Apr 14 11:38:11 +0000 2015) @AtlantisWade @NickEatsALot please @stocwach let us know when u actually START trading vs. preaching it isn't all roses as you try to imply
(Tue Apr 14 11:36:51 +0000 2015) @AtlantisWade thx bud wasn't down as mentioned just one of those days that was GOOD but was so close to GREAT ha
(Tue Apr 14 11:19:29 +0000 2015) @AtlantisWade point was less about the $8K and more about what happens as you scale .. @steenbab covers it in his book

(Mon Apr 13 20:20:27 +0000 2015) @GorkaHabib For sure, was just the last of many minimized gains for me today LOL
(Mon Apr 13 20:04:16 +0000 2015) This sums up my day LOL I covered $HZNP 1 minute before close -- good day over all but shit shit shit http://t.co/PxqVzGLQ2T
(Mon Apr 13 20:02:08 +0000 2015) $HZNP YOU WOULD .. son of a bitch
(Mon Apr 13 19:45:07 +0000 2015) $GBSN same move as $VLTC on Friday -- nice // (Apr 13-14:48) InvestorsLive: GBSN what I'd be looking for 3PM+ is like VLTC on Friady
(Mon Apr 13 19:43:21 +0000 2015) Point is, "PATIENCE" sometimes it works wonders, other times it pisses you off lol
(Mon Apr 13 19:41:07 +0000 2015) I don't mean to complain about a good day but sometimes it's just annoying - patience on $ADXS was up $8200 minimized to $2k grrrr
(Mon Apr 13 19:39:51 +0000 2015) And there goes $GBSN -- nice finish
(Mon Apr 13 19:37:06 +0000 2015) $GBSN did a pretty good job filtering folks out to I do hope we have another nice rally tomorrow for the long then short later this week
(Mon Apr 13 19:36:09 +0000 2015) $AMCN possible gapper
(Mon Apr 13 19:35:24 +0000 2015) Bad habit today on $ADXS $HZNP $GBSN - turning 3 $7-8K wins into $1-3K wins, ridiculous
(Mon Apr 13 19:14:09 +0000 2015) $GBSN got fueled up again by the $VLTC move and even $PSTR caught some perk too -- nutty
(Mon Apr 13 19:06:21 +0000 2015) @InvestNStars my partner takes opening day each as part of our deal since they were his tix from 1985 part of deal :)
(Mon Apr 13 18:45:32 +0000 2015) What a day out .. waited all winter for this woo wee
(Mon Apr 13 18:31:39 +0000 2015) $ADXS this whole move lately was likely a squeeze -- once that tide changes -- be careful dip buying
(Mon Apr 13 18:26:50 +0000 2015) $ADXS nearing $20 test
(Mon Apr 13 18:16:09 +0000 2015) $GBSN will check back 3PM + if $4.20s re claim but as I told chat no interest on dips since trend changed - sick runner tho all mornin'
(Mon Apr 13 17:53:35 +0000 2015) $ORMP beauty of a ripper
(Mon Apr 13 17:14:47 +0000 2015) $ADXS back to teen land later?
(Mon Apr 13 17:13:45 +0000 2015) Nice trade both ways in chat on $GBSN -- nice call @Nikkorico_ on the short side as well - not taking off radar for possible EOD move too
(Mon Apr 13 17:02:10 +0000 2015) $WBAI straight off scan for this red/green play !! Awesome now green  (Apr 13-12:18) InvestorsLive: WBAI from scan - perk

(Mon Apr 13 15:37:31 +0000 2015) Nice action on $ALTR over the last hour
(Mon Apr 13 15:28:06 +0000 2015) $GBSN awesome (Apr 13-10:20) InvestorsLive: scooped some $4.37 dips GBSN  (Apr 13-10:21) InvestorsLive: added more $4.29 again wide ranger
(Mon Apr 13 15:12:11 +0000 2015) $GBSN squeezing the "I'm short cuz the filings tell me to" or "I'm short cuz it's up!!" type of guys who ignore price action
(Mon Apr 13 14:58:38 +0000 2015) $GBSN ba da bing ... perk
(Mon Apr 13 14:41:27 +0000 2015) Almost to the $21 ... now we just need $22 ... $23 + blow off and I'll set some alerts to remind me lol @swedepilot  https://t.co/94NpF9ZqDP
(Mon Apr 13 14:18:13 +0000 2015) @GMoneyStock just PM me in the chat room
(Mon Apr 13 14:17:27 +0000 2015) $PSTR nice trade idea earlier .40-.50/share mover so far def just a sympathy rebound tho
(Mon Apr 13 14:16:23 +0000 2015) $OCN each day I get excited about the potential breakout on this one and lose .10-.20 last few days o well
(Mon Apr 13 14:03:11 +0000 2015) $VLTC - that's a perfect example of what the crowd does when it's crowded right back as if nothing happened.
(Mon Apr 13 13:58:51 +0000 2015) $GBSN dips getting absorbed (have your own plan) but be cautious on short side if this keeps grinding over $4.50
(Mon Apr 13 13:47:55 +0000 2015) $PSTR curling as sympathy rebounder to $VLTC ... love it when they fuel off each other $GBSN re-test on nHODs
(Mon Apr 13 13:46:51 +0000 2015) $GBSN here is part where everyone who short it "because it's up" freaks and covers into the $5 ramp
(Mon Apr 13 13:45:14 +0000 2015) $AXPW sweet off scan scooped it off LODs at .038825 avg
(Mon Apr 13 13:44:48 +0000 2015) $ADXS $20 finally
(Mon Apr 13 13:41:46 +0000 2015) First was $VLTC then there was $PSTR and now we have $GBSN ...  nuts
(Mon Apr 13 13:37:37 +0000 2015) $GBSN oh my

(Fri Apr 10 14:52:32 +0000 2015) $VLTC got thick all of a sudden huh? Figured it'd be jumpy off the dips but getting sold into still nicely
(Fri Apr 10 14:39:21 +0000 2015) $NVGN near $6

(Fri Apr 10 14:02:56 +0000 2015) @WuTrades @super_trades I don't tease him fool he holds for more than 10 minutes, holds for months
(Fri Apr 10 14:01:43 +0000 2015) $PSTR next leg -- if you're shorting this just because it's up -- thank you for the exits so far appreciate it
(Fri Apr 10 13:59:54 +0000 2015) @petedoom Great job !!
(Fri Apr 10 13:56:47 +0000 2015) $MBVX the Frost name has been doing wonders for stocks later hopefully parabolic for the trade here
(Fri Apr 10 13:52:26 +0000 2015) $WSTI real nice play @splendores  !!
(Fri Apr 10 13:46:46 +0000 2015) $OCN was a long idea off dips - this could do a $WBAI style rebound to $10-12 in coming days
(Fri Apr 10 13:44:09 +0000 2015) $VLTC if you're trading this stock ask yourself "What is my PLAN" if you don't have one ... get on the sidelines !!
(Fri Apr 10 13:43:36 +0000 2015) $HZNP possible that it gives up the entire gap and hits red later - shorted into pops this AM $28.30-50 range
(Fri Apr 10 13:42:35 +0000 2015) RT @TurnpikeTrader: @InvestorsLive mega call on $PSTR, and $VLTC spot on
(Fri Apr 10 13:39:05 +0000 2015) What a play $PSTR !! took some off +$1.20
(Fri Apr 10 13:35:05 +0000 2015) @smalltimeguy it's just not shortable ..... just like any other stock that isn't shortable on any given day ..

(Fri Apr 10 13:19:57 +0000 2015) @smalltimeguy SSR has nothing to do with being shortable ...

(Thu Apr 09 15:26:10 +0000 2015) @super_trades I dunno how you hold through this shit but it's amazing, you'll hold the next $3 drop and be one of few to get $7-10+ squeezer
(Thu Apr 09 15:23:56 +0000 2015) Amazing trade by @super_trades on $TRIL reminds me of $ARCW when everyone short it cuz it was "newsletter play" then got hosed LOL #props
(Thu Apr 09 15:03:50 +0000 2015) @moevillafane Make it $12
(Thu Apr 09 14:58:22 +0000 2015) re: last tweet $ALTR some say hit or miss, but wondering if I should have been more patient on that theory OR if it's hit or miss w/ these
(Thu Apr 09 14:57:58 +0000 2015) $ALTR just thinking out loud but -- aggravated I sold early but was this a no brainer or no? Mid $50s value $INTC thought ...
(Thu Apr 09 14:53:01 +0000 2015) All out $VLTC +$1.20-1.50/share -- crazy ideally some washes on $5.50s to get long again
(Thu Apr 09 14:42:38 +0000 2015) Sized down on $VLTC and will be pissed at $8 but that's trading
(Thu Apr 09 14:37:22 +0000 2015) Been a while since scoring big long like this !! $VLTC took rest off in other accounts trying to be patient lol http://t.co/aZGoMtkpjP
(Thu Apr 09 14:29:22 +0000 2015) $VLTC fresh highs
(Thu Apr 09 14:27:15 +0000 2015) $CRMD nice s/s idea 
[Apr 9 - 9:06]  InvestorsLive CRMD watch any good pops $8.50 + towards $8.70-80 for entry and then risk off $9 fader
(Thu Apr 09 14:24:32 +0000 2015) The fact that everyone is calling $VLTC the next $GENE makes me want to lock in more gains LOL but wouldn't mind if it was haha
(Thu Apr 09 14:23:44 +0000 2015) $INUV like buttttaaaah
(Thu Apr 09 14:21:36 +0000 2015) $YOKU nice so far from $16.11-16.17 shorts earlier
(Thu Apr 09 14:15:10 +0000 2015) $VLTC oh my $5
(Thu Apr 09 14:09:11 +0000 2015) $VLTC about to show folks what happens if you're a stubborn short
(Thu Apr 09 14:05:57 +0000 2015) China is hot -- be careful chasing old Chinese names this is where FIFO comes into play with the services trying to start low floaters
(Thu Apr 09 14:04:32 +0000 2015) $NVGN so far no confirm of trend -- will keep solid radar tho for this if it does develop -- so far the past lives on lol
(Thu Apr 09 14:03:56 +0000 2015) $ATHX slam red
(Thu Apr 09 13:57:57 +0000 2015) $ALTR thru $40 - nice idea from pre market
(Thu Apr 09 13:56:57 +0000 2015) $INUV thru HODs :) awesome !!
(Thu Apr 09 13:56:50 +0000 2015) $NVGN to CONFIRM the idea I need to see $6.30s over/under HOLD then grind from there -- until then cautious
(Thu Apr 09 13:55:21 +0000 2015) $ALTR ding ding $40 test
(Thu Apr 09 13:50:50 +0000 2015) I was too cautious on $DYAX and missed a great entry - upsetting I wanted a $31 push -- nice nail by @elkwood66 grrrr
(Thu Apr 09 13:50:13 +0000 2015) So far the price action does not suggest that on $NVGN however just going out on a limb while it's near $6
(Thu Apr 09 13:49:28 +0000 2015) $NVGN been a long time coming &amp;  EVERY push has sold off wouldn't be surprised to see more highs later cautiously looking dips for entry
(Thu Apr 09 13:47:57 +0000 2015) $AMCN gave everyone a nice re short opportunity on that PR and gap this AM .. nice fade
(Thu Apr 09 13:46:18 +0000 2015) $INUV on $3 test
(Thu Apr 09 13:29:20 +0000 2015) What an opportunity on $ALTR this morning !! Nice nail in chat for the reversal, sold down to 1/2 also great nail by @d4ytrad3
(Thu Apr 09 13:24:20 +0000 2015) $ALTR if they turned down $50 this can definitely ramp back up on $40 -- nice rally so far
(Thu Apr 09 13:10:41 +0000 2015) $ATHX nice gap
(Thu Apr 09 13:04:07 +0000 2015) $ALTR oh man

(Wed Apr 08 19:28:17 +0000 2015) $ADXS not long or short just waiting for a reactive trade later this week or once it fades as you saw there again shove and then yank again
(Wed Apr 08 19:25:35 +0000 2015) Why is it snowing WTF
(Wed Apr 08 19:23:47 +0000 2015) $ADXS has been filtering out size into each HOD then yanks it right down but not giving shorts any break ideally $20 rip soon for real short
(Wed Apr 08 19:23:04 +0000 2015) $ADXS feels almost as crowded as the first time -- broken record today to stay away from short on grind should be good play later this week
(Wed Apr 08 19:14:51 +0000 2015) $WSTI sweet they saved it again -- we get a re do tomorrow or Friday?

(Thu Apr 02 21:55:31 +0000 2015) RT @kyvinh_tran: @InvestorsLive wow! Really nice call and timing!! Very impressed
(Thu Apr 02 21:55:17 +0000 2015) @knighttrader85 they are not part of monthly no

(Thu Apr 02 19:46:26 +0000 2015) $NYMX going to hope for a gap Monday and nail it (if they don't raise)
(Thu Apr 02 19:39:18 +0000 2015) $CRMD keeping short over weekend - pretty much cashed up on rest except $NYMX
(Thu Apr 02 19:33:57 +0000 2015) $DYAX fresh highs - nice if patience I ran out :)
(Thu Apr 02 19:31:56 +0000 2015) @adognamedpip she is a thing of beauty, right into the wheel house and down she went !!
(Thu Apr 02 19:19:35 +0000 2015) $GBSN more slap
(Thu Apr 02 19:13:13 +0000 2015) Out rest of $DYAX +$1.40/share or so -- nice work !!
(Thu Apr 02 19:11:03 +0000 2015) $USO nearing red/green
(Thu Apr 02 19:03:13 +0000 2015) Little dip and rip then nHOD test $DYAX super
(Thu Apr 02 18:58:34 +0000 2015) $THCZ more blood

(Thu Apr 02 17:43:14 +0000 2015) $DYAX is now thru $26
(Thu Apr 02 17:36:58 +0000 2015) RT @Blackhorse93: I've leaned a lot from yr dvds and still learning.  Man, seriosuly thanks a ton for your efforts. @InvestorsLive
(Thu Apr 02 17:27:19 +0000 2015) 2 traders that come to mind are re: last tweet: @DerrickJLeon @Nikkorico_ struggle to make it, make it, but commend how well they deal w/ it
(Thu Apr 02 17:22:33 +0000 2015) To become a successful trader today not only do you have to become the 10% you need thick skin dealing w/ the 90% who want to put you down
(Thu Apr 02 17:19:00 +0000 2015) Sold 1/4 $DYAX well fucking done !!
(Thu Apr 02 17:03:40 +0000 2015) $THCZ I'm sorry I led my blind followers into a short opportunity that dropped 50% #oops (This is not my Cam lol) http://t.co/Q3YDD1GaCp
(Thu Apr 02 17:00:58 +0000 2015) Covered 1/2 $THCZ .155 and below
(Thu Apr 02 16:56:19 +0000 2015) $THCZ what's the hurry getting out? Seems like everyone is in a rush ...
(Thu Apr 02 16:50:24 +0000 2015) $DYAX trade idea unfolding here ... there's your .30-.50 speed up now we are nearing red/green test
(Thu Apr 02 16:44:41 +0000 2015) $DYAX yes sir
(Thu Apr 02 16:41:42 +0000 2015) $THCZ fresh lows, awesome short today !!
(Thu Apr 02 16:39:56 +0000 2015) RT @FraudResearch: $THCZ news today is very misleading considering stock promoter Roy Meadows is a note-holder converting +10M shares http:…
(Thu Apr 02 16:39:47 +0000 2015) @FraudResearch We'll read about $THCZ up there with $PHOT ... skull and cross bones was the tell
(Thu Apr 02 16:32:46 +0000 2015) $JCP HODs
(Thu Apr 02 16:26:57 +0000 2015) Another great call by @lx21 http://t.co/if5ZFaugtb $THCZ
(Thu Apr 02 16:26:03 +0000 2015) $THCZ time to make fresh lows
(Thu Apr 02 16:24:25 +0000 2015) @shaneblackmon well,I just assumed isn't he short them all but still up?
(Thu Apr 02 16:18:16 +0000 2015) $GBSN this is what we mean by 'crowded trade'
(Thu Apr 02 16:16:06 +0000 2015) @shaneblackmon Mr. Kass is !!
(Thu Apr 02 16:11:38 +0000 2015) $NYMX $1.87-88s s/s looking nice here ideally covering into washes and scale out through mid day lull
(Thu Apr 02 16:05:48 +0000 2015) $CRMD nice to take advantage of the weak shorties // (Apr 02-11:41) InvestorsLive: CRMD faster looking to take advantage of the pops
(Thu Apr 02 15:56:36 +0000 2015) $NYMX trying to become the next $AXN then when everyone is confident and buys for the $2 break it drops 30% on them?
(Thu Apr 02 15:46:07 +0000 2015) @aericthomas1 30 in June
(Thu Apr 02 15:44:30 +0000 2015) $GENE slowly does it -- back to nothingness

(Thu Apr 02 15:37:17 +0000 2015) Eclipse ** on my last tweet https://t.co/WqL3hz8clN
(Thu Apr 02 15:36:16 +0000 2015) Fast &amp; Furious 7 just heard on CNBC ... I mean shit I'm only 29 &amp; that makes me feel OLD the first one I had pimped out Eclipe w/ rims lol
(Thu Apr 02 15:23:10 +0000 2015) $THCZ they almost had another squeeze going but I think the fact it got skull and cross bones over night put the fork in it
(Thu Apr 02 15:22:27 +0000 2015) $SYRG round 2 - HODs
(Thu Apr 02 15:17:20 +0000 2015) $SYRG on ramp red/green
(Thu Apr 02 15:11:55 +0000 2015) $DYAX lock in along the way -- anything possible but nice trend so far -- nice work
(Thu Apr 02 15:11:40 +0000 2015) $DYAX the trade I posted on twitter earlier at $24.70s starting to speed up now I'd expect a fast rip .30-.50 then trend up from there
(Thu Apr 02 15:08:03 +0000 2015) Locking in some $OVAS along the way ... very nice so far
(Thu Apr 02 15:03:41 +0000 2015) $OVAS super -- on re-test of HODs!
(Thu Apr 02 15:02:09 +0000 2015) $NYMX $2 roast please for a trade
(Thu Apr 02 15:00:45 +0000 2015) @DrewOden Yep, fun one had a huge short then came alllll the way back
(Thu Apr 02 14:59:37 +0000 2015) $ADXS back under $15 .... $THCZ lil peak
(Thu Apr 02 14:32:11 +0000 2015) $NYMX nice entries in chat -- covered partial patience on rest if trend starts to break if it holds, will take the rest off
(Thu Apr 02 14:27:11 +0000 2015) $THCZ impressive recovery off the 40% drop
(Thu Apr 02 14:25:58 +0000 2015) @EZLifeTrader Don't short just to short!
(Thu Apr 02 14:23:09 +0000 2015) $OVAS ripping
(Thu Apr 02 14:20:15 +0000 2015) $NUGT dayam had a sick gain on that ramp and let it bleed back to scratch .. patience does not work lol
(Thu Apr 02 14:15:37 +0000 2015) $CAPN taking a page out of the the blue prints for $ADXS ha
(Thu Apr 02 14:14:19 +0000 2015) $NYMX nasty move !!
(Thu Apr 02 14:12:47 +0000 2015) $CAPN nice ramps
(Thu Apr 02 14:06:35 +0000 2015) $ADXS LODs
(Thu Apr 02 14:03:15 +0000 2015) $ADXS coming in nicely
(Thu Apr 02 14:02:35 +0000 2015) $GBSN sliding
(Thu Apr 02 13:59:09 +0000 2015) Super call by @offshorehunters for the swing low $10s
(Thu Apr 02 13:57:59 +0000 2015) $CCIH at $12
(Thu Apr 02 13:56:30 +0000 2015) $CRMD failed bounce
(Thu Apr 02 13:56:14 +0000 2015) $DYAX for me using washouts as entries starting with .50+ stop and then only adds would be $25 breaks and HOLDS until then - cannot commit
(Thu Apr 02 13:51:12 +0000 2015) $DYAX I am watching all dips scaling in -- thinking this has a huge red/green rip later and does $26-27 -- just a thought starter for now
(Thu Apr 02 13:46:37 +0000 2015) $NUGT can she trend all day?
(Thu Apr 02 13:45:59 +0000 2015) $CLDN off scan
(Thu Apr 02 13:45:42 +0000 2015) $THCZ oh my

(Thu Apr 02 13:37:51 +0000 2015) $THCZ on .20 test
(Thu Apr 02 13:37:09 +0000 2015) $THCZ going back to teens skull and crossbones today
(Thu Apr 02 13:36:01 +0000 2015) $OVAS beat chart nice rally -- nice spot by @d4ytrad3 long at open selling into rips along the way
(Thu Apr 02 13:01:25 +0000 2015) Good they saved $THCZ so far need it higher for a better entry lol
(Thu Apr 02 12:46:20 +0000 2015) I really do hope they save $THCZ though we need it higher to get a good short off - yesterday was paper thin squeezer
(Thu Apr 02 12:45:43 +0000 2015) $THCZ as warned yesterday -- this is NOT an over night -- someone is sell happy this morning

(Wed Apr 01 22:14:22 +0000 2015) Little bummed about missing the heart of $JDST move today -- have been tuned in all week to the move and totally missed today
(Wed Apr 01 22:06:11 +0000 2015) There's the $GDDY bash on @jimcramer says ring that register
(Wed Apr 01 21:01:37 +0000 2015) @OddStockTrader nice !!
(Wed Apr 01 20:03:51 +0000 2015) Nice rip $MU
(Wed Apr 01 19:57:34 +0000 2015) $CRMD nice crack into close
(Wed Apr 01 19:50:44 +0000 2015) $THCZ gonna be fun again tomorrow
(Wed Apr 01 19:30:37 +0000 2015) $COCP losing it
(Wed Apr 01 19:23:40 +0000 2015) $GDDY likely a bash tonight here: https://t.co/228OhFv3hF here is article: http://t.co/nDL7dQRcq2 likely gap downer
(Wed Apr 01 19:14:10 +0000 2015) $CRMD slap
(Wed Apr 01 19:09:44 +0000 2015) @modern_rock you meant $GBSN and I know it
(Wed Apr 01 18:56:58 +0000 2015) I was up the most at 9:35AM today ...  and a sweet day too .. sorta just sat here all day for no reason .. o well
(Wed Apr 01 18:39:10 +0000 2015) $GDDY area that needs to hold as peak = $26.10s until then same as all day likely
(Wed Apr 01 18:37:15 +0000 2015) $GDDY snap -- Cramer has video out that doesn't like it ... likely bashes it tonight
(Wed Apr 01 18:36:41 +0000 2015) Sick call $GBSN by @splendores in chat well done man
(Wed Apr 01 18:27:10 +0000 2015) Congrats to @modern_rock @mrockrulez been a long time coming !! Includes Bonus Chapters !! http://t.co/juEYORAQHr http://t.co/Acl2ZMycVH
(Wed Apr 01 18:17:32 +0000 2015) $GDDY $26.10  is the snap point $26 is wash -- we'll see if they can defend -- still partially short
(Wed Apr 01 18:14:46 +0000 2015) @EpicaCapital @modern_rock better
(Wed Apr 01 18:09:40 +0000 2015) RT @modern_rock: i got amazing news for u guys later on that @InvestorsLive will announce. So stay tuned.... i'm pretty excited about this.…
(Wed Apr 01 17:59:04 +0000 2015) Stocks are mad thin today
(Wed Apr 01 17:53:06 +0000 2015) $AAL nice rally
(Wed Apr 01 17:28:59 +0000 2015) RT @crawfish_poboy: $GBSN but but but the fundamentals don't warrant this move lol // You're right, they warrant a move to $7 lol please?
(Wed Apr 01 17:23:14 +0000 2015) $ADXS coming in nicely
(Wed Apr 01 17:22:26 +0000 2015) $JDST bottomless pit of joy
(Wed Apr 01 17:15:21 +0000 2015) $TRIL lol, all you can do is laugh what a fukin pay day for @super_trades amazing call
(Wed Apr 01 17:09:22 +0000 2015) $THCZ is trading 'different' now (was watching each tick on way up) first time they pulled bids
(Wed Apr 01 17:06:12 +0000 2015) $VLTC talk about a stuff into the $2.90s dayam shoulda locked in given the pre mature move - was looking for 3PM move
(Wed Apr 01 17:00:58 +0000 2015) I also stay away from crowded trades a lot with size on that same theory staying away from "obvious" but like $GENE I missed a good score
(Wed Apr 01 16:59:36 +0000 2015) If it was an "I told you so" I would have been long, I wasn't - just avoided the short ..
(Wed Apr 01 16:59:14 +0000 2015) This is not a "I told you so" but holiday crack weeks be SAFE -- $GBSN prime example of what's possible w/ momentum
(Wed Apr 01 16:48:02 +0000 2015) $VLTC there she is !!
(Wed Apr 01 16:44:40 +0000 2015) But again sick job to $THCZ - tried it Friday and today four times, each time they're stronger sick moves just don't trust overnight
(Wed Apr 01 16:43:18 +0000 2015) This is what happened with $PHOT https://t.co/0rSQdb3F1u re: $THCZ which is why I've been hoping pops to get short but super strong so far
(Wed Apr 01 16:41:59 +0000 2015) Not a bash on $THCZ but sick momentum props to the longs that road it up but each night the over night gets sketchier and sketchier
(Wed Apr 01 16:40:43 +0000 2015) Re: last tweet $THCZ ... $PHOT aka the one that was halted due to all the fake trading back and forth and BS going on
(Wed Apr 01 16:40:04 +0000 2015) So far $THCZ I've churned commissions four times &amp; haven't nailed YET but holy smokes does the vol feel like $PHOT we'll read about this one
(Wed Apr 01 16:37:38 +0000 2015) $GBSN my plan is still to get the momentum fizzle -- let the fundamental shorts get squeezed out then look for back side
(Wed Apr 01 16:36:54 +0000 2015) Covered 1/2 $JDST
(Wed Apr 01 16:32:26 +0000 2015) $JDST pay check
(Wed Apr 01 16:30:13 +0000 2015) $CLDN how about that chart .. hero to zero in a week and a half
(Wed Apr 01 16:16:02 +0000 2015) $JDST been a great trader along with $NUGT this week every friggin' day amazing range
(Wed Apr 01 16:12:27 +0000 2015) @modern_rock you see $FMSA today?
(Wed Apr 01 16:11:25 +0000 2015) $EKSO wowsa
(Wed Apr 01 16:07:36 +0000 2015) Long weekend coming up -- get your study on !! Talk to @IU_Tyler for bundle specials !! http://t.co/ekT283okG5
(Wed Apr 01 15:55:19 +0000 2015) $VLTC curling up again watch for $3 magnet I used $2.60s guide as risk on dips
(Wed Apr 01 15:51:26 +0000 2015) $GENE nice opportunity for shorts again into BS rumor -- likely started by shorts to get a better entry lol
(Wed Apr 01 15:45:24 +0000 2015) @johnwelshtrades the rumor is there is a rumor
(Wed Apr 01 15:42:44 +0000 2015) By the way I am being very cautious on shorts today like I wrote on scan -- it's shortened week -- be careful w/ these thin momentum trades
(Wed Apr 01 15:42:04 +0000 2015) Waiting for thefly to post UPDATE: $GENE rumor apparently April Fools joke .. next
(Wed Apr 01 15:40:14 +0000 2015) $GENE you know the beginning of the end is near when they start the "unconfirmed takeover chatter" rumors lol
(Wed Apr 01 15:34:21 +0000 2015) Having trouble reading $GDDY's balance sheet - how do they account for this asset? Goodwill? http://t.co/BFpypVNJkF
(Wed Apr 01 15:29:10 +0000 2015) RT @lx21: http://t.co/o15BCXgvcp latest addition: short $THCZ
(Wed Apr 01 15:24:42 +0000 2015) Don't forget .. it's holiday week no trading Friday anything is possible w/ crack plays $GBSN $VLTC -- company doesn't matter momentum does
(Wed Apr 01 15:11:37 +0000 2015) $GBSN this is where company is one thing but momentum is another ... yes fundamentals matter later but not on front side
(Wed Apr 01 15:07:42 +0000 2015) $GBSN stubborn short rally
(Wed Apr 01 15:06:50 +0000 2015) $ADXS nice rebound today near $15s
(Wed Apr 01 15:05:43 +0000 2015) $GDDY nice timing on s/s add --&gt; (Apr 01-10:52) InvestorsLive: added GDDY
(Wed Apr 01 15:03:05 +0000 2015) Perfect $DYAX entries $25.70s + avg and made it to $24.90-25.08s .. dangit .. still fading ...
(Wed Apr 01 14:54:20 +0000 2015) $NDRM nice call again @offshorehunters you been rockin' it ... killer call blast from past
(Wed Apr 01 14:44:11 +0000 2015) $GDDY if I had more than fun buck size I'd be out long ago, waiting for THE trade should be fun right now lost like 300 happy meals so far
(Wed Apr 01 14:43:06 +0000 2015) $THCZ nice stuff - rescaling -- will keep trading this til we get that nice 50% wash one day
(Wed Apr 01 14:42:10 +0000 2015) $THCZ dip held well -- taking trade off and ideally get more push to get short into next push again.
(Wed Apr 01 14:39:37 +0000 2015) @traderblog1987 it's not a loss until you sell !! ;)
(Wed Apr 01 14:32:22 +0000 2015) @ScoopDogg13 think that was two days ago, and covered when I said I covered  ... next question?
(Wed Apr 01 14:31:35 +0000 2015) $GDDY losing fun bucks so far -- but is worth the shot at nailing a happy meal only spot I'd add more than fun bucks is $25.50s breakdown
(Wed Apr 01 14:30:24 +0000 2015) Short $THCZ (Apr 01-10:25) InvestorsLive: started THCZ short .244
(Wed Apr 01 14:22:58 +0000 2015) $AAL nice flush today

(Fri Mar 27 18:41:45 +0000 2015) Not every day is roses and butterfly's but    missed one good cover on $KRFT where I wanted then spiked .40 on me --coulda woulda shoulda
(Fri Mar 27 18:39:56 +0000 2015) Not how I wanted to end Friday but at the same time -- happens rounding error based on trades lately -- have good weekend guys !!

(Fri Mar 27 18:00:22 +0000 2015) Been in tune with the Gold trade this week traded it real well, been out of tune with the $KRFT trade this week, traded it real poorly

(Fri Mar 27 16:18:12 +0000 2015) In other words, I'd be prepared for a gap up and push but it'd have a weak open and thus take it off radar but @OzarkTrades never would
(Fri Mar 27 16:16:06 +0000 2015) Another #NeverStopLearning moment for me was watching @OzarkTrades he'd always still nail a trade after gap down but I'd take it off radar

(Wed Mar 25 19:49:30 +0000 2015) Posted wrong Monday in last tweet -- here's Monday through Wednesday -- good luck all rest of day http://t.co/OfJFKfhjp2
(Wed Mar 25 19:47:38 +0000 2015) Minimized for sure today but $QUNR easy winner just was ultra patient and lost track of it $VBLT had good adds but started starter too early
(Wed Mar 25 19:43:24 +0000 2015) Likely $NUGT crunched into close but had lost $2900 on $FOLD and just made $3k on goldilocks so that puts me up $119 in back acct lol
(Wed Mar 25 19:42:32 +0000 2015) All covered $NUGT very nice covered the $FOLD trade from earlier in Etrade
(Wed Mar 25 18:40:46 +0000 2015) $APOL teenie bopper land again
(Wed Mar 25 18:22:50 +0000 2015) @modern_rock you buying a man purse?
(Wed Mar 25 18:21:17 +0000 2015) @bullriders1 said the permabull lol
(Wed Mar 25 18:12:14 +0000 2015) $ORMP #oneanddone #onedaystand #walkofshame nLODs
(Wed Mar 25 18:03:59 +0000 2015) Well $QUNR +$3k to -$2.5k being patient but nothing wrong w/ taking it off -- when wrong be wrong happens will look for next entry
(Wed Mar 25 17:38:39 +0000 2015) Just like that guys $VBLT :)
(Wed Mar 25 17:30:51 +0000 2015) $VBLT seems to have exhausted all the early shorts -- each pop has failed to squeeze so far
(Wed Mar 25 17:13:07 +0000 2015) $NUGT yes sir
(Wed Mar 25 17:12:47 +0000 2015) The $KRFT &amp; Heinz merger explained: http://t.co/u55rqVRtse
(Wed Mar 25 17:04:49 +0000 2015) @DerrickJLeon They call that $KRFT in our world -- now go make some Mac and Cheese
(Wed Mar 25 17:03:34 +0000 2015) The more who get aggressive short into $7s longer it stays up here -- but once they run outta early shorties fueling it it'll yank fast
(Wed Mar 25 17:03:06 +0000 2015) $VBLT is not a chase short but watch all pops  -- as soon as they walk it's $6.80 in a quick flash focus on ENTRY tho on POPS only not chase
(Wed Mar 25 16:54:41 +0000 2015) $KRFT I tell ya, damnit -- right idea just didn't get proper scale add and ditched the trade what a sick trade
(Wed Mar 25 16:45:50 +0000 2015) Think about it .......... and never forget it -- every little bit adds up :) Learn more here: http://t.co/LVS4Eus3X2 http://t.co/AZh6yPmDS0
(Wed Mar 25 16:43:49 +0000 2015) @BullZoneTrader I got an answer for that -- gimme a minute to download the pic
(Wed Mar 25 16:42:59 +0000 2015) @BullZoneTrader why you cover so early you wimp
(Wed Mar 25 16:29:11 +0000 2015) Those that got @TandemTrader this $VBLT is a lot like $VSR example -- looking for the STUFFING action discussed
(Wed Mar 25 16:24:38 +0000 2015) @BullZoneTrader eh, I didn't add where I should have -- was waiting for "one more o-shit" ha no props needed
(Wed Mar 25 16:22:45 +0000 2015) Still trading $AXMM $VBLT $QUNR $NUGT and partial loser $FOLD but may skip out soon weather is incredible today first time this year
(Wed Mar 25 16:21:01 +0000 2015) Pros and cons of a 'back' acct -- my Etrade I put stuff I want to "give a chance" w/ patience ie: not watch every tick sometimes backfire
(Wed Mar 25 16:20:10 +0000 2015) $FOLD half my fault half forgotten order, sold 1/2 $11.25s then had open order on way down that filled, didn't realize til sub $11
(Wed Mar 25 16:19:28 +0000 2015) Main gainer is $AXMM followed by $FB and $NUGT $KRFT -- losers was not selling all $FOLD again and $VBLT early starter - rest = good
(Wed Mar 25 16:18:42 +0000 2015) Have pretty nice day going but I def over stayed on my starter $VBLT (because I am partial size let it grind looking for the other 3/4 add)
(Wed Mar 25 16:17:36 +0000 2015) RT @smarthasan158: @InvestorsLive Thank you Nate ! http://t.co/aXaa8nxBWZ
(Wed Mar 25 16:17:25 +0000 2015) @BullZoneTrader nice score buddy !!
(Wed Mar 25 16:12:05 +0000 2015) @DrewOden orrrr not :)
(Wed Mar 25 16:11:51 +0000 2015) $KRFT there's the $85 flush, minimized the hell out of this but perfect top call by $MS
(Wed Mar 25 16:10:56 +0000 2015) You ever forget you're short something? Dangit $QUNR lol -- minimized a big trade had $3k + winner now small winner -- dumb
(Wed Mar 25 16:08:38 +0000 2015) Covered down to 1/2 $KRFT
(Wed Mar 25 16:07:21 +0000 2015) $KRFT sorta like that -- squeeze 'em all out and settle back watch for $85 flush and exits
(Wed Mar 25 15:49:56 +0000 2015) Dayammmm @modern_rock check $BIIB ugh
(Wed Mar 25 15:44:32 +0000 2015) $KRFT - hearing $MS desk turning cautious on the name here. Says they would be sellers and NOT buyers here $86-87 // per @thenotablecalls
(Wed Mar 25 15:43:40 +0000 2015) $KRFT squeezed out all intraday shorts using the bias of many firms that came out pre market saying it was worth $82-83 - now settling back
(Wed Mar 25 15:41:48 +0000 2015) Trading is about knowing WHEN to watch tickers -- that's why $FB was on the radar last night -- super nasty !!
(Wed Mar 25 15:39:43 +0000 2015) $FB more red
(Wed Mar 25 15:32:57 +0000 2015) $AXMM likely a 'relief rally' and I will be looking to short into pops
(Wed Mar 25 15:32:40 +0000 2015) Covered 1/2 $AXMM +.54/share
(Wed Mar 25 15:31:12 +0000 2015) Wow $ESPR hadn't watched since they squeezed it like mad -- nice flush today
(Wed Mar 25 15:25:19 +0000 2015) $ORMP fresh lows
(Wed Mar 25 15:20:52 +0000 2015) $AXMM down 50% now
(Wed Mar 25 15:16:16 +0000 2015) $KRFT came to the wheel house with some power :) Courtesy of the early shorts
(Wed Mar 25 15:11:43 +0000 2015) $AXMM into the .5x's as we wanted pre market !!
(Wed Mar 25 15:08:06 +0000 2015) In other news, $AXMM lol
(Wed Mar 25 15:06:36 +0000 2015) $VBLT what do you mean level 2 manipulation ?? I don't see it LOL http://t.co/G61efeT0a8
(Wed Mar 25 14:40:00 +0000 2015) $NUGT near red
(Wed Mar 25 14:37:04 +0000 2015) @TTN12 hahhaa only kidding -- thanks I'll be sure to consult the urban dictionary in the future !!
(Wed Mar 25 14:35:28 +0000 2015) Just canceled my "wish" order on $AXMM this AM from .71 in case a washout out of the gate now I'll wait for lower lol
(Wed Mar 25 14:33:59 +0000 2015) $AXMM sub .50s today?
(Wed Mar 25 14:32:21 +0000 2015) $AXMM fresh lows
(Wed Mar 25 14:25:56 +0000 2015) @TTN12 that's who I was referring to lol
(Wed Mar 25 14:24:06 +0000 2015) $LL what a cluster fuk of a trend this morning huh?
(Wed Mar 25 14:22:37 +0000 2015) $HZNP that's how it works -- take it off radar one day LOL
(Wed Mar 25 14:18:34 +0000 2015) $QUNR that a baby !!
(Wed Mar 25 13:59:58 +0000 2015) Regarding $AXMM every pop on this will be seen as a liquidation event for promoters use the volume while it's there to sell worthless paper
(Wed Mar 25 13:59:58 +0000 2015) Regarding $AXMM every pop on this will be seen as a liquidation event for promoters use the volume while it's there to sell worthless paper
(Wed Mar 25 13:57:04 +0000 2015) All covered rest of $FB -- nice one +$1.10 on the last batches over all great trade !!
(Wed Mar 25 13:53:54 +0000 2015) $RADA straight off scan -- weak open red/green ramp
(Wed Mar 25 13:52:36 +0000 2015) $FB straight down from shorts :)
(Wed Mar 25 13:49:40 +0000 2015) $VBLT get this piglet up for us will ya -- squeeze stubborn early then we can start to work in for the flush back to $6s
(Wed Mar 25 13:47:00 +0000 2015) $FB wammmmm bammm thank you ma'am
(Wed Mar 25 13:45:31 +0000 2015) $ORMP bottomless pit of joy
(Wed Mar 25 13:45:01 +0000 2015) @modern_rock wow, sick entry on TTL this AM on $ORMP for the short at $7.90
(Wed Mar 25 13:40:36 +0000 2015) $AXMM going go down further than you think today imo
(Wed Mar 25 13:39:17 +0000 2015) HOMEWORK get you PREPARED to EXECUTE &amp; PROFIT -- that's why we do it !! What a start to the morning !!
(Wed Mar 25 13:32:46 +0000 2015) $AXMM thanks for playin'
(Wed Mar 25 13:29:32 +0000 2015) Trade 'em well !!
(Wed Mar 25 12:33:46 +0000 2015) $AXMM skull and crossbones and they decide to walk away ?? down to $1 pre market https://t.co/Wukiq2Hz4q

(Tue Mar 24 17:55:14 +0000 2015) $ORMP nice rally
(Tue Mar 24 17:54:01 +0000 2015) $JOEZ sick rip
(Tue Mar 24 17:52:42 +0000 2015) $AAL another nice fade today -- missed it this morning tho
(Tue Mar 24 17:42:07 +0000 2015) $AXMM steady fade now since the failed breakout attempts should get awful sketchy into close especially w/ the skull and cross bones
(Tue Mar 24 17:25:47 +0000 2015) Pretty cool you forget how far people travel for things sometimes: @EdsonDefreitas1 who is from Brazil made it to @Traders4ACause last year

(Tue Mar 24 15:54:42 +0000 2015) $AXMM please get her up for us -- they are tossing around lotta shares here -- higher the better for the short
(Tue Mar 24 14:54:10 +0000 2015) $NUGT and $JDST great trades out of the gate I am done w/ this trade !! $QUNR locked it all in patiently waiting for a few others to set up
(Tue Mar 24 14:47:42 +0000 2015) Make sure you check out this interview with @offshorehunters I'll be doing a blog post later today about here DVD: https://t.co/K2b2u5ExNs

(Tue Mar 24 14:43:58 +0000 2015) $QUNR awesome shorts in chat $39.85  -- now testing $39 (Mar 24-10:23) InvestorsLive: started QUNR s/s
(Tue Mar 24 14:42:15 +0000 2015) @russell_barry why?
(Tue Mar 24 14:39:16 +0000 2015) $NUGT $JDST that's what we wanted!
(Tue Mar 24 14:38:03 +0000 2015) $FB fader off the $85.50s over/under
(Tue Mar 24 14:37:18 +0000 2015) $AXMM looks like a dip, trap the chasers guess we'll have to wait for them to exhaust the late shorts -- ideally get some adds into pops
(Tue Mar 24 14:30:33 +0000 2015) I'm thinking they just exhausted all dip buyers on $AXMM and we're about to snap under $1 -- ideal covers = .70-.80 range or lower
(Tue Mar 24 14:30:03 +0000 2015) $AXMM curious if they let this one go to the .60-.70s today like usual before they pick it up or defend this level -- what do you think?
(Tue Mar 24 13:53:15 +0000 2015) $RADA I'd put it in the "too easy" category with $AMRN and missed it lol -- I've been trained for patience and a battle -- no such battle
(Tue Mar 24 13:49:12 +0000 2015) I used this morning to buy the washouts on $FOLD with risk on $11.20s -- trade plan is in last tweet
(Tue Mar 24 13:48:48 +0000 2015) $FOLD is the type that either fails to hold trend and fizzles off radar OR does a 20-25% day back to $13 + in one candle risk at $11.20s

(Mon Mar 23 13:58:25 +0000 2015) $MVIS likely squeezes on this streetsweeper hit IF it holds $3.70 battle ground -- they've been trapping for days now they just crowded it
(Mon Mar 23 13:53:20 +0000 2015) I always cover these ones too early but nice adapt in the morning -- was clear they hit a wall so I went ahead and put on the short $AXMM
(Mon Mar 23 13:52:21 +0000 2015) Although I expected more on $AXMM before pulling the plug u can see how BS that market was already down 50% most of which was an air pocket
(Mon Mar 23 13:51:28 +0000 2015) $FOLD there's your play ...
(Mon Mar 23 13:50:03 +0000 2015) Remember as I tweeted Friday, when Brighton aka $AXMM pulls the plug they pull the fuking plug careful on bounces I'll look at .50-.70 range

(Fri Mar 20 18:37:35 +0000 2015) @NerdElert also if trade is against me and comes back to even - never wanted it in first place, I'll be patient after being wrong = no go ha
(Fri Mar 20 18:36:46 +0000 2015) @NerdElert @stt2318 I usually am good about profits into washes but when I'm thinking big picture hardest thing as a trader for me
(Fri Mar 20 18:36:19 +0000 2015) I tweeted about this a while back my weakest point as a trader is after being up huge and being patient, when to not be patient any longer
(Fri Mar 20 18:31:12 +0000 2015) I'm talking the real deal promos that have mailers going out at same time, but they have limited success w/o trapping first $AXMM
(Fri Mar 20 18:30:55 +0000 2015) There has been a big shift in OTC promos over past few years where the exit strategy isn't the emails/mailers it's the trap/squeeze $AXMM
(Fri Mar 20 18:21:49 +0000 2015) $AXMM rather easy to borrow among different brokers so if they catch early shorts could be fun, once they do pull support it's DEADLY
(Fri Mar 20 18:21:15 +0000 2015) $AXMM I do NOT believe this is a real market at all support via different market makers and sell via ARCA hidden all day
(Fri Mar 20 18:20:39 +0000 2015) Just my two cents on $AXMM -- good luck all
(Fri Mar 20 18:20:28 +0000 2015) $AXMM imo -- much like many old promos of past if you catch a short that's their exit strategy once parabolic THEN I am interested
(Fri Mar 20 18:20:01 +0000 2015) $AXMM point is we all know its a pump - stay cautious on it be careful of just shorting to short b/c they are still in trap mode imo
(Fri Mar 20 18:19:39 +0000 2015) $AXMM imo churns the vol over and over and then once they lock a few shorts you'll see how they can uptick it on air
(Fri Mar 20 18:19:06 +0000 2015) $AXMM imo 'exit' move will be the mailers + squeeze created by the wash volume - thus being the end of the promotion
(Fri Mar 20 18:18:35 +0000 2015) $AXMM imo will continue to do the washing machine approach until they feel they've trapped enough and then pull paper off offer to squeeze
(Fri Mar 20 18:18:08 +0000 2015) $AXMM imo is all fake vol back and forth back and forth with the intent to trap shorts who see the large vol and think it's real
(Fri Mar 20 18:16:00 +0000 2015) @trushift lol on a serious note, how weird is that dude ha

(Thu Mar 19 13:57:00 +0000 2015) $MVIS could melt all day if $3.80s over/under don't put up much of a fight and put in a short term top
(Thu Mar 19 13:56:36 +0000 2015) $ARTX nice breakout was a dip buyer for us
(Thu Mar 19 13:47:26 +0000 2015) Don't tell @crawfish_poboy but $MVIS is not exclusive ;)

(Wed Mar 18 19:24:02 +0000 2015) $GGAL only reason for loss was sizing -- had a good entry then added b/c I was watching with $PAM and the rest -- picked wrong one
(Wed Mar 18 19:23:41 +0000 2015) $LL trade I was actually short on a chase just in case it continued to fade off was down more, then got long for breakout - so minimized
(Wed Mar 18 19:21:57 +0000 2015) Not bad $3k but my mistake was forcing $GGAL otherwise big likely covered top but time for gym exhausted of screens http://t.co/UvW99jc5As

(Wed Mar 18 14:00:14 +0000 2015) I would look for a short on big pops of $AXXE but not currently short -- I think more importantly longs should be careful
(Wed Mar 18 13:59:42 +0000 2015) $AXXE FDA does not "approve" dietary supplements -- thus my thought is the PR is fraudulent and misleading and @SEC_Enforcement may halt it

(Tue Mar 17 23:52:16 +0000 2015) @Castisos thats @siricortrader he's still trading in room but obviously $SPY tightened up so $UVXY trades like that won't happen in this mkt
(Tue Mar 17 23:50:18 +0000 2015) $SYNC was a trade idea today for possible swing on that $2.50 break nice close so far
(Tue Mar 17 23:49:22 +0000 2015) I was prepared for a good fight on that $AMRN after Friday's move and then bam lights out Monday/Tuesday -- doh nice wash
(Tue Mar 17 23:48:51 +0000 2015) $AMRN like I said last night .. @splendores and I were talking about it today - it was TOO easy that's why I missed the bulk of it LOL

(Tue Mar 17 20:03:31 +0000 2015) $RMGN $ARTX I should have taken the gains into pre mature breakout vs. expecting gap 3:30PM + much more telling
(Tue Mar 17 20:02:47 +0000 2015) 3rd thing was $RMGN and $ARTX I was up nicely (these were in Etrade) &amp; then just sorta canned them at the close WAIT for 3:30PM for gappers
(Tue Mar 17 20:02:14 +0000 2015) I expect $GGAL to be a big trade coming up in the next few days but wanted to get my feet wet in there, but added randomly twice - avoidable
(Tue Mar 17 20:01:50 +0000 2015) 2nd thing on $GGAL was first day I was getting a "feel" for how it traded -- traded a little too much size want to learn more about it
(Tue Mar 17 20:01:29 +0000 2015) Happy that I stuck to my stop loss there - could have been double but obviously would be 1. not be stubbornly patient no reason to be
(Tue Mar 17 20:00:48 +0000 2015) The first thing would be $ESPR I knew I did perfect in Wedbush account covered perfect but extended the loss in ETC account
(Tue Mar 17 20:00:23 +0000 2015) Small loss today compared to what's been going on lately happens but three things I would have changed http://t.co/T0wVahf3Pq
(Tue Mar 17 19:47:55 +0000 2015) $BDE nice one from $9.30s .. starting to add up nicely ideally exit into any good $10 squeezer that's about all I can shout about into close
(Tue Mar 17 19:45:27 +0000 2015) @KevinoNYC Yep I was long when the TTL indicator went off and @modern_rock alerted I should have known to sell
(Tue Mar 17 19:42:51 +0000 2015) Stopped $ARTX $RMGN I picked the wrong ones .. $MVIS apparently was the one to load up ONLY
(Tue Mar 17 19:40:08 +0000 2015) $WLT sick rip
(Tue Mar 17 19:34:46 +0000 2015) $MVIS nice end runner -- lock in along the way if you took the trade (Mar 17-14:18) InvestorsLive: MVIS if it perks likely speeds up some
(Tue Mar 17 19:33:11 +0000 2015) $ESPR just print it already will ya? #onehundoclub
(Tue Mar 17 19:32:52 +0000 2015) Should have taken profits on $ARTX and $RMGN early when I had them - was long mid day had that 2-3pm push then fizzled #oops
(Tue Mar 17 19:32:18 +0000 2015) More highs $BDE sweet
(Tue Mar 17 19:29:32 +0000 2015) $CRMD nice call @NasdaqCowboy

(Tue Mar 17 19:05:34 +0000 2015) $MVIS and there's that move :)
(Tue Mar 17 19:00:14 +0000 2015) $BDE right on tap
(Tue Mar 17 18:52:16 +0000 2015) @modern_rock was that the candle? LOL dangit was scooping dips earlier wondered why it cracked so fast makes sense now
(Tue Mar 17 18:29:35 +0000 2015) $ARTX there she goes off support
(Tue Mar 17 17:43:43 +0000 2015) @SunriseTrader you forgot the word "only" ...  CHOMP :)
(Tue Mar 17 17:40:48 +0000 2015) Sorta like $MVIS -- very crowded keeps grinding
(Tue Mar 17 17:40:29 +0000 2015) $BDE watching for EOD potential squeezer seems like everyone wants to short this thing but it's holding trend well
(Tue Mar 17 17:39:32 +0000 2015) Had one good trade on $ESPR and 1 stubborn one that stung (I knew it but since was small over all I let it grind me) happens
(Tue Mar 17 17:26:28 +0000 2015) $RMGN at this rate will be watching for EOD ripper if this trend holds

(Mon Mar 16 23:37:33 +0000 2015) If $AMRN put up little fight I woulda scaled much more size but I was sitting there w/ no adds to $3.32 entry telling myself PATIENCE wait!
(Mon Mar 16 23:34:57 +0000 2015) $AMRN was 'too easy' this AM so much so that I was waiting to size in cuz I sure as hell didn't think they'd just walk at open w/ no fight

(Mon Mar 16 00:59:06 +0000 2015) @Nikkorico_  @jcspe85 right not bashing anyone but considering what my borrow fees were just from a few shorts can't imagine 2-3 months lol
(Mon Mar 16 00:55:03 +0000 2015) @modern_rock @jcspe85 just take @OzarkTrades for example paid about $1k a day for a week on $GENE size before nailing mega bucks
(Mon Mar 16 00:54:12 +0000 2015) @modern_rock @jcspe85 yep and highly likely to be bought in even the best brokers would called it in by now not realistic to hold that long

(Fri Mar 13 21:41:42 +0000 2015) @AchillesXIIX @FierceDeity300 The funny part is we all want that CRACK you nail &amp; cover but then biggest move down comes AFTER initial crack
(Fri Mar 13 21:41:01 +0000 2015) @AchillesXIIX @FierceDeity300 The only time you scale on a trade like that is into a winner or pops on back side and HELPS a lot
(Fri Mar 13 21:40:45 +0000 2015) @AchillesXIIX @FierceDeity300 one thing I've learned is if you play front side, whatever you'd play full size use no more than 1/4 size
(Fri Mar 13 21:35:03 +0000 2015) @AchillesXIIX @FierceDeity300 I guess that's why you said IU by name and then called the others furu chats, fair enough :)

(Fri Mar 13 18:41:37 +0000 2015) Minimized my $CYTX swing today but $C keeping me alive @CraigTrader put it on my radar this week w/ the range and volume
(Fri Mar 13 18:39:22 +0000 2015) @Jeff_Levitz cough cough: @TomKellyLV @dveprek @lx21 @OzarkTrades and now @elkwood66 joining ranks ..  just to name a few ...
(Fri Mar 13 18:38:38 +0000 2015) @Jeff_Levitz And then you realize that everyone multi-million dollar trader you know is mainly short biased ;)
(Fri Mar 13 18:35:18 +0000 2015) FOOD FOR THOUGHT: I'll get short 45k $AMRN with no fear but yet can't long more than 6k shares LOL #IJustdonttrustbeinglong
(Fri Mar 13 18:30:58 +0000 2015) @EpicaCapital What's the matter $GENE and $CTIC not filling you ?? LOL

(Fri Mar 13 18:26:31 +0000 2015) RT @TraderTLZ: @InvestorsLive, thanks, great alert in chat,  huge profits on this $C sell off today
(Fri Mar 13 18:22:41 +0000 2015) Meanwhile, $C more LODs
(Fri Mar 13 18:03:24 +0000 2015) Feels weird to be long $AMRN but made a lil back (1/4) from earlier short crap -- very happy I covered !! Ideal exit $3 rip to $3.20s
(Fri Mar 13 18:02:42 +0000 2015) $ADXS nice short earlier guys -- starting to add up nicely
(Fri Mar 13 18:02:04 +0000 2015) $ECIG just got 'vaporized' to LODs
(Fri Mar 13 17:44:49 +0000 2015) $AMRN fresh highs
(Fri Mar 13 17:34:14 +0000 2015) @russell_barry yep likely trap some SSR folks shove them into red/green etc -- tick tock before the $$ raise
(Fri Mar 13 17:32:00 +0000 2015) $CYTX likely only rebounding b/c of SSR quick ramp and stuff then slap back down -- $$ raise anytime imo
(Fri Mar 13 17:31:39 +0000 2015) $C non-stop bleed
(Fri Mar 13 17:28:02 +0000 2015) $ADXS $12 test
(Fri Mar 13 17:19:14 +0000 2015) @traderdags I do in all products !
(Fri Mar 13 17:18:11 +0000 2015) $AMPE = long off dips all week on scan -- what a nice 3 day rally -- big from scan last night

(Fri Mar 13 16:55:53 +0000 2015) $AMRN should be sweet for next week trending &amp; trapping at this level for that $3 rip, lost some $ earlier but can't wait for Mon/Tues

(Fri Mar 13 15:11:26 +0000 2015) Strategy on $AMRN https://t.co/tPYiJrbNlB never forget when on front side of the move !!
(Fri Mar 13 15:07:04 +0000 2015) I'm going to have my programmer check the coding here but this thing never lies .... http://t.co/azULHi1EdE
(Fri Mar 13 14:51:48 +0000 2015) The old me woulda said "eh, let's just see what $AMRN can do" "I'll wait" then I'd have a $20k loss later at $2.70-3 and ruin my weekend lol
(Fri Mar 13 14:46:08 +0000 2015) $C on LODs
(Fri Mar 13 14:45:17 +0000 2015) Meanwhile $HZNP fades a bit
(Fri Mar 13 14:44:18 +0000 2015) $AMRN maybe just a stuff into the HOD move but not always the case and better to be out and re-enter later than wish you had exited
(Fri Mar 13 14:41:39 +0000 2015) $AMRN have to respect the trend -- ideally stubborn shorts get fried and give us a better opportunity later -- lost on first attempt
(Fri Mar 13 14:36:33 +0000 2015) Covered the $SUM short - very nice fader
(Fri Mar 13 14:20:53 +0000 2015) $TXMD from scan -- nice push

(Fri Mar 13 14:12:33 +0000 2015) @CraigTrader I thought insiders selling $35 million should be seen as bullish ?? :)

(Tue Mar 10 22:40:57 +0000 2015) Dayammmm $CYBR what a nice fader also $CRM took it off watch straight down
(Tue Mar 10 22:33:50 +0000 2015) @lilchriss22 was fine trade, also had two spots to exit but just held too long
(Tue Mar 10 22:22:54 +0000 2015) @TheIntradayBros real time vs. QB "Oh was earnings breakout la de dah" we trade real time and a + e/r doesn't mean up you should know that
(Tue Mar 10 22:18:03 +0000 2015) @BitcoinBravo not ego, no room for that in trading you'll get slaughtered just a good add vs. bad add
(Tue Mar 10 22:17:19 +0000 2015) @TheIntradayBros Thanks Capt. Obv. anything else to add?
(Tue Mar 10 22:16:56 +0000 2015) @GrubHard Trade was today, was for the short that we nailed
(Tue Mar 10 22:14:45 +0000 2015) $LL trade draw a line at $30.80s you'll see why I had written that as an aria of interest -- if NEW stay away til trend breaks then wallaaa
(Tue Mar 10 22:11:26 +0000 2015) No reason to short $URBN I started in on a pop, trend never formed and cut it off but saw many trying to find top -- no need in this market
(Tue Mar 10 22:10:53 +0000 2015) The biggest thing in this "changed" market is to WAIT for the trend to confirm your thoughts take $URBN for example http://t.co/WjvrsQwPjX
(Tue Mar 10 22:09:24 +0000 2015) @BitcoinBravo well that's just silly, that doesn't make you money I haven't looked at market for ages
(Tue Mar 10 22:08:34 +0000 2015) On market gap down days I like to look for weakness on names that don't typically trade with $SPY for example $NWBO $CRMD weak open and ramp
(Tue Mar 10 22:07:50 +0000 2015) Lots have complained "This market is hard" "somethings changed" I don't see it - COUNTLESS opps still, only reason for losses = fight trend
(Tue Mar 10 22:06:54 +0000 2015) $LL was my best trade, netted about $5300 over all on it $GERN was second best trade but that was offset by $RMGN o/n loss
(Tue Mar 10 22:06:06 +0000 2015) Today I lost on $HZNP and $CRMD (first time &gt; second time) and small $URBN -- why? Because I added into losers like a chump

(Tue Mar 10 19:09:46 +0000 2015) $DRRX watch into close if red/green -- w/ insider buys yesterday could have staying power
(Tue Mar 10 19:06:49 +0000 2015) $CYTX how many days before the raise do you guys think now that the Roth conf pump is done? a) 1 day b) 3 days c) 1 week d) 2 weeks ??

(Tue Mar 10 18:38:08 +0000 2015) $CYTX so far Roth looks like a snoozer if they had something good to say woulda been done by now

(Tue Mar 10 15:36:49 +0000 2015) $CRMD there it is
(Tue Mar 10 15:12:37 +0000 2015) $GERN fresh highs -- zero interest in the short until a parabolic speed up
(Tue Mar 10 15:05:19 +0000 2015) Sitting on my hands for an hour waiting for trades -- no prime set ups = patience DON'T FORCE !!

(Mon Mar 09 19:13:32 +0000 2015) The thing to think about on $TLPY is -- is it worth the 90% down side risk on a halt for the 10% potential gap up if it opens tomorrow ...
(Mon Mar 09 19:04:51 +0000 2015) Another hour another 50% drop on $TLPY or what? At what point does fear &gt; reality into close and cause a panic

(Mon Mar 09 14:04:08 +0000 2015) It's one thing to trade big pops &amp; the price action short on $TLPY but to make a thesis short is b/c of likely halt = not a good reason
(Mon Mar 09 14:03:29 +0000 2015) I see lots of tweets about $TLPY and halting sure may halt that's w/o question given the BS promo but don't let that be your trade thesis
(Mon Mar 09 13:50:22 +0000 2015) If .25 breaks here on $TLPY you will have all Friday + mornnig dip buyers starting to panic for exits, don't forget their history

(Fri Mar 06 03:55:08 +0000 2015) @DerrickJLeon @FierceDeity300 ya many traders do it that's why I keep $3 dollars on my desk ;)
(Fri Mar 06 03:49:20 +0000 2015) @DerrickJLeon that was something I worked on over 6-8 months - scaling size is not just going 2x 3x 4x it's a whole lot more invovled
(Fri Mar 06 03:48:51 +0000 2015) @DerrickJLeon I may be wrong but try it, try to work towards larger size but not on the first or second entry - start as if it was normal
(Fri Mar 06 03:48:22 +0000 2015) @DerrickJLeon from the outside my prespective is this: Your scaling up is just going bigger vs. same size on start and adding to winner
(Fri Mar 06 03:46:24 +0000 2015) @DerrickJLeon but like you said easier said than done, but don't under estimate three $5-7k days and how fast it adds up
(Fri Mar 06 03:45:31 +0000 2015) @DerrickJLeon then we shake it after a day or two, start grinding and bang all of a sudden breakout day and we're at highs and high fiving
(Fri Mar 06 03:45:01 +0000 2015) @DerrickJLeon Eric and I have countless conversations over the years after dumb battles counting how many days it'll take to make back
(Fri Mar 06 03:43:20 +0000 2015) @DerrickJLeon it's harder than it seems until you kick that "feeling" and just focus on onward and upward, then we laugh about it in 3 weeks
(Fri Mar 06 03:42:41 +0000 2015) @DerrickJLeon You're pretty good at shaking off a trade and reality is this - you try for it, you FAIL, you trade well and boom new highs
(Fri Mar 06 03:41:44 +0000 2015) @DerrickJLeon That's the biggest problem with the "make back" approach, a lot is never enough you forget how much $7k is

(Thu Mar 05 14:44:29 +0000 2015) $CLDX nice breakout long idea from scan - I do not like the short til we get $33-35 + range at some point (if it goes there) otherwise avoid

(Wed Mar 04 20:52:14 +0000 2015) $MSTX possible gapper again .60 is the trigger for me for any real upside
(Wed Mar 04 16:13:19 +0000 2015) @sba504packagers the idea is to not bring a bad trade or bad day over into the next .. was the idea of the tweet days back
(Wed Mar 04 16:04:04 +0000 2015) @sba504packagers why tomorrow ? What's tomorrow ? Lol or did you have a bad day today ?
(Wed Mar 04 15:42:09 +0000 2015) Heading off guys good luck today !!
(Wed Mar 04 15:42:02 +0000 2015) $MSTX watch it .57 to .60 range gets hot for gapper until then just potential breakout
(Wed Mar 04 15:08:35 +0000 2015) $OREX beauty -- nice one guys off the dips
(Wed Mar 04 15:04:49 +0000 2015) $KBIO $1 ripper would be nice for tomorrow or Friday then we'd have a $CYCC $CYTX $ONCY style set up
(Wed Mar 04 15:04:23 +0000 2015) $ATOS is rehatched so nothing new but since they keep posting news at some point could catch a trend, until a TREND still a Grade A turd
(Wed Mar 04 15:03:56 +0000 2015) $ATOS I see no "big" play but idea was if washouts possible long entry &amp; add on $2.30 CONFIRM of hold risk $2.20s until then not interested
(Wed Mar 04 15:00:28 +0000 2015) Was trading $KBIO $ATOS and the internet went out on @JetBlue had some flash forwards of possible $20-30k losses upon landing LOL - I'm done
(Wed Mar 04 14:39:02 +0000 2015) And there's $ONCY under a buck
(Wed Mar 04 14:38:02 +0000 2015) $OREX dip buys on all dips after first washout if higher low was plan -- nice one !!
(Wed Mar 04 14:06:46 +0000 2015) You may see all three $ONCY $CYCC and $CYTX touch .9x's today -- seems to be buzz kill after $CYCC offering
(Wed Mar 04 14:02:25 +0000 2015) @lexram @modern_rock His 2nd and 3rd biggest days ever were when I was flying he has premium membership to my itinerary for life ;)
(Wed Mar 04 13:50:02 +0000 2015) I think $CYTX update out this AM reaffirms it's trash and if you hold it over night you're at risk of major offering at ANY TIME like $CYCC
(Wed Mar 04 13:44:51 +0000 2015) $CNDO even more -- nice from that $3 cross so far
(Wed Mar 04 13:43:15 +0000 2015) @modern_rock haha I am I am -- I'm flying but no worries won't have access after 1030AM :)
(Wed Mar 04 13:37:31 +0000 2015) $CNDO now over $3 -- I ended up ditching the swing trade 2 days ago in Etrade for a loss but dayam nice launch pad action
(Wed Mar 04 13:33:45 +0000 2015) The key with determining if $ATOS will be a good play is to watch how bearish folks get and if it HOLDS trend then may be decent play
(Wed Mar 04 13:29:10 +0000 2015) And then any big para blow off on $ATOS (if a good rip were to come) is potential short -- obviously reactive trade  outta the gate
(Wed Mar 04 13:27:38 +0000 2015) $ATOS most folks are used to shorting the pops and may get crowded - over $2.50 could catch some legs ideal exit would be $2.50-2.70 ramp
(Wed Mar 04 13:19:09 +0000 2015) $GENE on the $5 test #pumpbegone
(Wed Mar 04 12:57:02 +0000 2015) Looks like $CYCC is trickling over to $ONCY with a nice gap down

(Tue Mar 03 19:21:00 +0000 2015) $OREX nice slam
(Tue Mar 03 18:59:32 +0000 2015) Something @modern_rock told me that's opposite what feels natural but yet so RIGHT Learn More: http://t.co/tmhZIHHqsA http://t.co/lQs9ONu52m
(Tue Mar 03 18:54:17 +0000 2015) Never size into a trade that is not doing as you expected totally avoidable still a great day BUT could have been yet another huge $20k day
(Tue Mar 03 18:53:52 +0000 2015) Key takeaway on $JD - be PATIENT wait for the trade set up to come to YOU and don't fire random darts, your results will be random as well
(Tue Mar 03 18:53:11 +0000 2015) Did that twice on $JD then finally looked like a long -- fact is I was wrong three times in a row but most importantly I let mysel fbe wrong
(Tue Mar 03 18:52:47 +0000 2015) That cost me a few bucks waiting, then figured hey this thing may go red and switched my position on $JD rather quickly w/o any thought
(Tue Mar 03 18:52:15 +0000 2015) Once it didn't hold $29.50s over/under my plan was to ditch it, rather than just suck it up and knock $29s out I wanted to wait for pops
(Tue Mar 03 18:51:49 +0000 2015) Every time I long I have an idea based around .50 or whole dollar marks re: $JD but I started in before letting it CONFIRM trend
(Tue Mar 03 18:51:19 +0000 2015) $JD I was bullish, chart was good figured if it held dip outta the gate it'd have some legs .. so I started in and added to 1/2 too quickly
(Tue Mar 03 18:50:55 +0000 2015) Besides TTLing $JD there is a key take away from it ...
(Tue Mar 03 18:49:04 +0000 2015) @parabol128 I TTL'd the shit outta $JD and then BTL'd the shit outta it too, and then repeated to beat my head against wall 3 times

(Tue Mar 03 17:18:57 +0000 2015) My $JD trading is embarrassing today sorta went back to the well -- (didn't alert the two trades) and turned into a dumb loss lol
(Tue Mar 03 17:16:28 +0000 2015) $OREX wait for the piggy to come to you !! Then attack http://t.co/ymYYtjWWox
(Tue Mar 03 17:10:51 +0000 2015) The moment on $OREX when everyone and their Mom was bullish and BUY at all cost .. and then it started to pull back .. and then dipped again

(Tue Mar 03 16:24:25 +0000 2015) @dynamitecaps if you tweet me about this again I'm going to block you
(Tue Mar 03 16:22:11 +0000 2015) Market is 100% sympathy lately hat tip to @shaneblackmon for the $VVUS idea forgot about that sucker lol
(Tue Mar 03 16:17:15 +0000 2015) $ONCY back on lows
(Tue Mar 03 16:14:36 +0000 2015) RT @shaneblackmon: $VVUS short squeeze starting // Nice eye near $3
(Tue Mar 03 16:07:44 +0000 2015) $OREX is gonna fry some early shorts and then give us an amazing trade -- nice ramp so far
(Tue Mar 03 15:56:46 +0000 2015) $OREX oh my #kidincandystore

(Tue Mar 03 15:46:07 +0000 2015) @stock_choices noticing a trend with you and @crawfish_poboy you guys eating your $CAPN Crunch lately ??
(Tue Mar 03 15:44:01 +0000 2015) Took it off and although I took a small dent on $JD this market is UNREAL it hasn't impacted my day at all now since I let myself be wrong
(Tue Mar 03 15:42:54 +0000 2015) The THING about $JD and this market is you take it off and move on -- had a plan didn't stick to it BUT
(Tue Mar 03 15:42:01 +0000 2015) But I didn't stop there on $JD saw a comment 'always does this and sells off' and emotionally short into weakness and doubled the loss
(Tue Mar 03 15:41:33 +0000 2015) $JD I'll discuss later poor trade by me this morning in more way than one committed to it before it confirmed trend and stopped emotionally
(Tue Mar 03 15:33:40 +0000 2015) $ONCY longs not to worry here's a TUTORIAL for what to do with your shares !! https://t.co/KfGc0ugsWZ
(Tue Mar 03 15:32:02 +0000 2015) @Ballstothewa11 @cuddlybunny_ No worries bud, $ONCY will make good wall paper :)
(Tue Mar 03 15:30:50 +0000 2015) $CLNE red/green ramp
(Tue Mar 03 15:30:50 +0000 2015) $CLNE red/green ramp
(Tue Mar 03 15:23:46 +0000 2015) Sometimes in this market I feel like companies purposely put out fluff to attract shorts only to squeeze them into an offering LOL
(Tue Mar 03 15:22:18 +0000 2015) The biggest thing I've had to learn in the past few weeks is not to underestimate how many idiots will keep buying dips on these bio's lol
(Tue Mar 03 15:20:00 +0000 2015) $ONCY thanks for playin' key takeaways: 1.) cheaper it is allows you to buy more shares  2.) not a loss until you sell 3.) bash all shorts
(Tue Mar 03 15:00:56 +0000 2015) $TASR nice fader so far
(Tue Mar 03 14:59:44 +0000 2015) $QIHU fresh highs
(Tue Mar 03 14:54:51 +0000 2015) $QIHU same exact set up yesterday 2 days in a row off scan -- nice
(Tue Mar 03 14:50:33 +0000 2015) $ONCY you know the drill
(Tue Mar 03 14:50:26 +0000 2015) $EYES nice morning emotion out of the gate for getting some trades off -- nice fade after they squeezed out some early shorts
(Tue Mar 03 14:50:07 +0000 2015) $JD I was too bullish -- bought the dip no go - didn't have any adds but now watching all pops for fader if trend can't form
(Tue Mar 03 14:29:19 +0000 2015) $ONCY love when they do that looked like death pre market and then ramppppp hopefully they caught a few early shorts and give a nice pop s/s
(Tue Mar 03 13:52:59 +0000 2015) Really enjoyed this interview with @DerrickJLeon http://t.co/YpfOibg5WO $EYES $BIOC $ONCY $JD $LL $FNJN http://t.co/LTFVOZY7i4
(Tue Mar 03 13:40:35 +0000 2015) $BIOC reminds me of $ARNA at $6 where we all knew it was going down 50% but crowded -- once emotion fades it'll drop, until then jumpy
(Tue Mar 03 13:15:19 +0000 2015) @BklynGM for sure, already posted a bunch in chat -- also scan looks decent
